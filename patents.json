    "abstract": "Systems and methods are provided for generating and/or modifying a shopping list from a mobile advertisement. The advertisement can be targeted from a predefined algorithm, from multiple algorithms, or generated in real time based on items presented to a user. The advertisement may be random. When the advertisement is selected for viewing, it provides the option for saving information about the advertised product to a shopping list. The list may be a remote list that may be accessed via a deep link URL, a cloud-based storage solution, and/or it may be local to the mobile device.\n\n",
    "description": "\n\nFIELD OF THE TECHNOLOGY\n\n\nThe technology of this application relates generally to digital advertisements and more specifically but not exclusively to creating and/or modifying an electronic list by adding an item associated with a digital advertisement to the list.\n\n\nBACKGROUND OF THE TECHNOLOGY\n\n\nDigital advertisements are often displayed within mobile applications or on mobile websites and often link to other mobile websites or HTML pages, such that when a consumer clicks on or otherwise selects the advertisement, that consumer is taken to a website other than the one they are browsing. This can be annoying to consumers, especially if they did not select the advertisement on purpose.\n\nDigital Consumer Packaged Goods (CPG) companies, among others, sell products through brick and mortar stores. As such, there exists a need to find innovative ways to provide effective digital ads that are accepted by consumers and that lead to in-store/brick and mortar purchases.\n\nAdditionally, with the rise of new services such as curb-side pickup and grocery delivery services, consumer shopping habits have changed. Impulse purchases, which currently occur while a consumer walks through a store, do not occur when a consumer plans/executes their shopping trip from home, work or some other location other than in the store and never physically enters the store.\n\nIt may be advantageous to create systems and methods for generating advertisements with Add-To-List capabilities to facilitate adding products to a shopping list for a consumer who views or otherwise selects an advertisement.\n\n\nBRIEF SUMMARY OF THE TECHNOLOGY\n\n\nMany advantages will be determined and are attained by one or more embodiments of the technology, which in a broad sense provides systems and methods for generating and/or modifying a shopping list for a consumer who views or otherwise selects a digital advertisement. An item may be added to the shopping list upon the consumer selecting the advertisement, or the consumer may be provided the option to (i) add the item while viewing the advertisement, (ii) not add the item, (iii) open the list to view which items have already been added, or (iv) add the item to the list at a later time (in which case one or more reminders may be manually or automatically be configured or a trigger event may be set which causes the item to be added to the list).\n\nIn one or more implementations of the technology, a computer-implemented method is provided for generating a digital shopping list. At least a portion of the method may be performed by a computing device that includes at least one processor. The method may include presenting an electronic advertisement associated with a product, for display on a mobile device. The method also may include the mobile device receiving input indicating a selection of the advertisement, and the mobile device routing a mobile application (âappâ) on the mobile device to an online shopping list. The method may also include the mobile device adding an identification of the associated product to the shopping list.\n\nIn one or more implementations of the technology, a system for generating a digital shopping list from an advertisement displayed on a mobile device is provided. The system may include a mobile advertisement presentation module, stored in memory, that provides a mobile advertisement, that advertises a product, for display on a mobile device. The system may also include an advertisement selection module, stored in memory, that detects when an advertisement has been selected for viewing, and a routing module, stored in memory, that routes a browser located on the mobile device to a shopping list. The system may include a list generating module, stored in memory, that enters information about the advertised product into the shopping list, and at least one processor that executes the mobile advertisement presentation module, the advertisement selection module, the routing module, and the list generating module.\n\nIn one or more implementations of the technology, a non-transitory computer-readable medium including one or more computer-executable instructions is provided which, when executed by at least one processor of a computing device, cause the computing device to present an advertisement for a product on a display of a mobile device. The computer-executable instructions may also cause the computing device to detect a selection of the advertisement for viewing, open a remote shopping list, and enter information about the advertised product into the shopping list.\n\nThe technology will next be described in connection with certain illustrated embodiments and practices. However, it will be clear to those skilled in the art that various modifications, additions and subtractions can be made without departing from the spirit or scope of the claims.\n",

    "description": "\n\nBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n\nField of Invention\n\n\nThe instant invention relates to certain new and useful improvements in a combined spreader and rake hand tool. The invention also relates to improvements in a combined spreader and rake hand tool, which is particularly useful in moving gravel and leveling gravel and stone having sizes up to about 2 inches and is particularly adapted for spreading and smoothing aggregate for concrete, cement, or other materials which containing binder and an aggregate.\n\n\nPrior Art\n\n\nThere exist many prior devices for moving ground material, such as rock, dirt, gravel, debris, leaves, etc. In the case of hand tools, these commonly include, rakes, spreaders and hoes. With respect to stone and aggregate, many factors dictate aggregate size, including particular application, method of placement, regional availability of materials, admixtures etc. and accordingly the type of hand tool which is used to move the same.\n\nIn the case of making a desired concrete surface and in order to minimize cracking, it is ideal to use a mix design containing aggregates ranging from natural sand, to 1Â¼â³ at an average of 18-22% of each size by weight. Hand tools available on the market today fail to provide an adequate tool for moving such aggregate by hand. Accordingly, there remains a need for an improved hand tool to aid in moving aggregate as well as other surface material.\n\n\nSUMMARY OF INVENTION\n\n\nIt is an object to provide a tool of the above mentioned character that is simple and sturdy in construction and that is so constructed and arranged that it can be used as a tool for spreading material, such as stone and aggregate for concrete while the operator remains in a standing position, and the handle of the tool is inclined at a convenient angle for operating the same from the body portion or blade of the tool toward an operator.\n\nA further object is to provide a dual function spreader and rake for multiple tasks, including raking stones, vines, debris, leaves, etc., and spreading and smoothing ground surface which may include dirt, rock, and/or aggregate.\n\nA further object of this invention is to provide a spreader and rake having pitched teeth on a first elongated side of a back support plate connected to a handle, and having pitched edge on an opposing second elongated side of the back support plate.\n\nA further object of this invention is to provide a readily cleanable spreader and rake.\n\nA further object of this invention is to provide a unitary head forming part of a spreader and rake.\n\nA further object of this invention is to provide a spreader and rake having a sufficient weight and strength structure to pulverize ground and rake loose material.\n\nA further object of this invention is to provide a spreader and rake hand tool having pitched teeth on a first elongated side of a back support plate which provides sufficient rigidity and strength to cut and remove grass, vines or ground surface and will sink into loose dirt and will pulverize the dirt while the debris is being raked up.\n\nA further object of this invention is to provide a hand spreader and rake may be turned over and using a pitched level edge to serve in pulling, pushing or spreading debris, aggregate or material along the ground.\n\nAccordingly, the invention is directed to a spreader and rake tool including a head having a body portion or blade, preferably made of steel or other rigid material, that can be of uniform thickness from a toothed working edge thereof to the level working edge thereof, with a handle secured to a back support plate portion which connects normal relative to the back plate portion, a first plate portion extending from a first side of said back plate portion having the toothed edge and a second plate portion extending from a second side of said back plate portion having the level edge, wherein each of the plate portions extend at an angle of from between 5 to 45 degrees relative to the back support plate portion. To accomplish the purposes of the invention it is necessary that the axis of the handle extend at an angle of approximately 90 degrees to the back support plate portion, enabling the tool to be used both as a raking and spreading or leveling tool, in either case with the working edge thereof directed toward the operator and the handle inclined at an angle toward the operator so that the operator can stand in such a position as to rake or smooth surface material.\n\nBy the use of my invention, the operation of moving heavy and relatively large aggregate can be carried out successively from a standing position, because of the character of the tool comprising the rigid and durable blade with its angled plate portions present a unique tool which renders it easier to move aggregate and/or scraping, rake or smoothing operation to be performed while the operator is in a standing position greatly speeding up the operation over that possible with the tools previously used for this purpose. This is due to the fact that the unique blade configuration and with portions angled as previously stated, that the the blade or body portion can be engaged with the aggregate, debris or surface with the handle extending an angled relative to the surface in a most effective way in order to reduce fatigue of the user.\n\nOther objects and advantages of my invention will appear as the description of the drawings proceeds. I desire to have it understood, however, that I do not intend to limit myself to the particular details shown and described, except as defined in the claims. With the above and related objects in view, this invention consists in the details of construction and combination of parts, as will be more fully understood from the following description, when read in conjunction with the accompanying drawing.\n",

    "description": "\n\nFIELD OF THE INVENTION\n\n\nThe present invention relates to agricultural harvesters. More specifically, the present invention relates to a drive system for a weed seed mill for a combine harvester.\n\n\nBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION\n\n\nAs is described in U.S. Pat. No. 10,314,232 to CNH America LLC (the '232 patent), which is incorporated by reference in its entirety and for all purposes, an agricultural harvester known as a âcombineâ is historically termed such because it combines multiple harvesting functions with a single harvesting unit, such as picking, threshing, separating and cleaning. The separating system of the combine directs the non-grain material to a residue system. The residue system distributes the non-grain material through a chopper, a spreader, and/or a windrow chute before it is distributed onto the field.\n\nCrop residue that is discharged onto fields often contains lost grain and seeds, including shrunken crop seeds and weed seeds. Most or all of the seeds are in the chaff that exits the cleaning system. Many of the seeds are not destroyed and remain viable after exiting the combine. Viable seeds can germinate and sprout in the field, resulting in the spread of undesired weeds and potential crop disease. Weeds that sprout are typically killed by tillage or chemical treatment, however, weed control measures such as these are costly. Moreover, these weed control measures require additional equipment passing over the field, which can increase soil compaction and adversely impact the condition of the field.\n\nThe '232 patent discloses a weed seed mill positioned for destroying the weed seeds through shearing forces. A weed seed mill may also be referred to herein or in the art as a seed processor, chaff mill, chaff mill assembly, or chaff processor. The seed mill is configured to receive crop residue from a cleaning system of the combine and destroy or damage seeds through shearing forces, so that when the seeds exit the combine, the seeds are no longer viable and able to germinate. The weed seed mill may be powered by a drive system including a shaft mounted pulley that is driven by a belt that is indirectly connected to the engine of the combine (for example). Due to the rearward location of the seed processor in the combine, the shaft mounted pulley is positioned outside of the straw hood of the combine and either in or near a rear wheel well of the combine. For combines having steerable rear wheels, such positioning of the pulley presents an obstacle because the pulley or the belt that is mounted to that pulley could interfere with the steered rear wheels. While it is possible to limit the turning radius of the steerable rear wheels, such a modification may be viewed as an undesirable restriction on the maneuverability of the combine.\n\nIn view of the foregoing, it would be desirable to incorporate a drive system for a weed seed mill into the rear end of the combine without impacting performance or maneuverability of the combine.\n\n\nSUMMARY OF THE INVENTION\n\n\nAccording to one aspect of the invention, an agricultural harvester includes a straw hood having a hollow interior space for receiving material other than grain (MOG) from a threshing and separating system of the harvester and chaff from a cleaning system of the harvester. A drive system is provided for powering a straw chopper and a weed seed mill. The drive system includes a single belt positioned outside of the straw hood that is wound at least partially around (i) a straw chopper pulley that powers the straw chopper, (ii) a weed seed mill pulley that powers the weed seed mill, and (iii) a power take off shaft of the harvester that receives power from an engine or other power source of the harvester.\n",

    "description": "\n\nFIELD OF DISCLOSURE\n\n\nThe disclosed subject matter pertains to apparatuses and methods for calibration of power equipment, for example, generating adjustment data for power equipment settings and achieving improvements to quality of cut of the power equipment.\n\n\nBACKGROUND\n\n\nManufacturers of power equipment for outdoor maintenance applications offer many types of machines for general maintenance and mowing applications. Generally, these machines can have a variety of forms depending on application, from general urban or suburban lawn maintenance, rural farm and field maintenance, to specialty applications. Even specialty applications can vary significantly, from sporting events requiring moderately precise turf, such as soccer fields or baseball outfields, to events requiring very high-precision surfaces such as golf course greens, tennis courts and the like.\n\nProfessional turf managers spend significant time developing familiarity with the operating capabilities of the power equipment used to manage turf, particularly for specialty applications. Capabilities of these machines enable high quality turf maintenance, but can be very complex to understand and operate in a manner that consistently achieves high quality results. Further complicating matters is the effect of dynamic environmental conditions and weather. Different climates, seasons and weather can add further variance to the performance of outdoor power equipment. Significant experience is therefore generally required to successfully maintain high precision turf for multiple applications, in various climates and at differing times of the year.\n\n\nBRIEF SUMMARY\n\n\nThe following presents a simplified summary in order to provide a basic understanding of some aspects of the disclosure. This summary is not an extensive overview of the disclosure. It is not intended to identify key/critical elements or to delineate the scope of the disclosure. Its sole purpose is to present some concepts of the disclosure in a simplified form as a prelude to the more detailed description that is presented later.\n\nProvided herein, in one or more embodiments of the present disclosure, are devices and methods for calibrating and optimizing settings of power equipment apparatuses. In some embodiments, a mobile device application can be utilized to interface with a control device of a power equipment machine. Current settings of the power equipment can be entered into the application in conjunction with desired cut parameters. The mobile device application can generate one or more improved setting values to improve quality of cut for the machine. In some embodiments, current environmental conditions (e.g., turf moisture) or turf characteristics (e.g., type of grass, etc.) can be entered into the mobile device application and utilized for generating the improved setting value(s). In embodiments where the improved setting value(s) pertain to machine characteristics that can be automatically or robotically set by the control device of the machine, the mobile application can send the improved setting value(s) over a wired or wireless communication link with the control device. In other embodiments, for example where the machine characteristics are manually set, the improved setting value(s) can be displayed on a graphical display of a mobile device, enabling an operator to manually adjust the power equipment machine according to the improved setting value(s). In various embodiments, the mobile device application can be programmed with optimal settings for a given power equipment machine, and for a range of desired cut parameters, machine settings or environment or turf conditions, as provided herein, or as known in the art or as made known to one of ordinary skill in the art by way of the context provided by the present disclosure.\n\nIn further embodiments, the disclosure provides a system. The system can include a processor for executing instructions to perform operations of the system and a memory for maintaining the instructions executed by the processor. In various embodiments, the operations can comprise receiving, by the processor, input parameter data representing a characteristic pertaining to an instance of vegetation or a machine for mowing the vegetation. In additional embodiments, the operations can comprise determining, by the processor, a value of a mechanical parameter of the machine as a function at least in part of the input parameter data. In one or more other embodiments, the operations can comprise outputting, by the processor, additional data representing the determined value of the mechanical parameter of the machine.\n\nTo accomplish the foregoing and related ends, certain illustrative aspects of the disclosure are described herein in connection with the following description and the drawings. These aspects are indicative, however, of but a few of the various ways in which the principles of the disclosure can be employed and the subject disclosure is intended to include all such aspects and their equivalents.

Field of the Invention\n\n\nThe present invention relates to a robotic lawnmower and, more particularly, to a robotic lawnmower that includes a Bluetooth speaker as a sound suppression means and a chute to serve as a seed spreading means.\n\n\n2. Description of the Related Art\n\n\nSeveral designs for a robotic lawnmower have been designed in the past. None of them, however, include a solar powered robotic lawnmower which includes a sound suppression means and a seed spreading means. The lawnmower includes a Bluetooth speaker on the device to serve as a sound suppression means. A user may play their desired audio media through the Bluetooth speaker in order to drown out the sound produced when mowing the grass. Additionally, the lawnmower includes a chute to serve as a seed spreading means. In one embodiment, the chute is located at the side of the device and serves to disperse seeds as the device mows a user's lawn. The lawnmower further features blades on a bottom end of the device to facilitate the cutting of a lawn as the device travels. A remote control is also included to allow a user to remotely control the device. It is known that individuals often have the need to maintain a healthy and cut lawn. However, some people may not have the time nor the strength to constantly find themselves mowing a lawn. Therefore, there is a need for a robotic powered lawnmower to aid a user in automatically mowing a lawn. Additionally, the lawnmower will disperse seeds which will maintain healthy plant life along an individual's lawn. The sound suppression speaker will maintain an enjoyable environment for an individual while the lawn is being mowed.\n\nApplicant believes that a related reference corresponds to U.S. Pat. No. 10,136,576 issued for a robotic work tool system which includes a mower a vacuum and a blower.

    "description": "\n\nFIELD\n\n\nThe present disclosure relates to an adjustment apparatus for a forage harvester and in particular to an adjustment apparatus for adjustment of the chopper knives on a chopper drum.\n\n\nBACKGROUND\n\n\nThe adjustment apparatus disclosed is suitable for use with an agricultural harvesting machine, in particular, a forage harvester, provided with a chopper drum assembly comprising rotatable chopper drum having a plurality of knives, in use the chopper drum rotating opposite a stationary shear bar. There is a gap between the shear bar and the knives into which crop is fed during harvesting, the fed crop then being chopped between the chopper knives and the shear bar. Such harvesting machines require regular maintenance of the chopper drum assembly and the shear bar in order to maintain the quality of the chopping process.\n\nThe chopping of incoming crop causes wear on the chopper knives and on the shear bar of the chopping assembly. This action may also cause the shear bar to become incorrectly adjusted. If chopping is performed using blunt knives and/or with a shear bar that is incorrectly adjusted this leads to a reduction in the chopping quality and increased energy consumption in driving of the chopper drum assembly.\n\nIt is therefore necessary at periodic intervals to perform maintenance actions on the chopper drum assembly for example to replace blunt knives and/or to adjust the shear bar in order to obtain a suitable cutting gap. During such maintenance it is important to ensure the replacement chopper knives are located in the correct position. Aligning and fixing in place of the replacement chopper knives can be a time consuming operation.\n\nThe adjustment apparatus disclosed has as an advantage that it addresses the above problems. Other advantages will become clear from the following description.\n\n\nBRIEF SUMMARY\n\n\nAccording to a first aspect of the disclosure, an adjustment apparatus for use with a chopper drum, in which the chopper drum is supported from a housing and mounted for rotation about a rotational axis and further provided with a plurality of circumferentially spaced knife supports to which at least one chopper knife can be adjustably secured, the adjustment apparatus comprises a lateral element, at least one location element for location of the adjustment apparatus with respect to the chopper drum and at least one radially inwardly directed guide surface, the or each radially inwardly directed guide surface describing an outer path of an unworn chopper knife, the or each guide surface is adjustably located with respect to the lateral element.\n\nThis has as an advantage that the adjustment apparatus may be calibrated for different diameters of chopper drum.\n\nPreferably, the or each guide surface is provided on an individual spacer element, the or each spacer element being adjustably located with respect to the lateral element.\n\nPreferably the or each spacer comprises first and second portions, the first portion including the guide surface and the lateral element further comprises first and second limbs.\n\nPreferably, the or each spacer element is provided with first and second openings and the lateral element is provided with complementary first and second openings in the region of the or each spacer element.\n\nMore preferably, the first opening of the spacer element is provided in the second portion of the spacer element and the first opening of the lateral element is provided in the first limb of the lateral element. More preferably, the second opening of the spacer element is provided in the first portion of the spacer element and the second opening of the lateral element is provided in the second limb of the lateral element.\n\nPreferably the first and second openings of the spacer element are threaded while the first opening of the lateral element is threaded and the second opening of the lateral element is elongate.\n\nPreferably the first limb of the lateral element is provided with a further threaded opening.\n\nPreferably, the adjustment apparatus is provided with first, second and third fastenings for location in the first, second and further openings of the lateral element.\n\nAccording to a second aspect of the disclosure a calibration system comprises an adjustment apparatus according to the first aspect of the disclosure and a chopper drum supported from a housing and mounted for rotation about a rotational axis and further provided with a plurality of circumferentially spaced knife supports to which at least one unworn chopper knife is correctly secured.\n\nPreferably the chopper drum and the housing comprise a part of a forage harvester. Alternatively, the chopper drum and the housing comprise a part of a calibration rig.\n\nAccording to a third aspect of the invention a method of calibration for an adjustment apparatus forming part of system according to the second aspect of the disclosure, comprises the steps: locating at least one locating surface of the adjustment apparatus with respect to a receiving surface of the chopper drum housing or a receiving surface of a chopper drum, aligning the at least one locating surface with a side of the chopper drum housing to allow engagement of engagement means to secure the adjustment apparatus in relation to the chopper drum housing, inspecting the spacer elements on the adjustment apparatus adjacent to the chopper drum and adjusting the or each of the spacer elements with respect to the transverse lateral element as required, once all of the spacer elements have been inspected and any necessary action taken, releasing the engagement means and removing the adjustment apparatus.\n",

    "abstract": "A trimmer attachment for use with a lawn mower includes a deck mounting plate configured for attachment to the lawn mower, one or more mounting tabs extending up from the deck mounting plate, a curved pivoting arm rotatably coupled to the one or more mounting tabs, a pivoting motor for rotating the pivoting arm, and a trimmer head coupled to the pivoting arm. Rotation of the pivoting arm by the pivoting motor causes the trimmer head to rotate between a stowed position and an engaged position.\n\n",
    "description": "\n\nBACKGROUND\n\n\n\n1. Field of the Invention\n\n\nThe present application relates to lawn mowers and trimmers. In particular, the present application relates to trimmer attachments for attachment to the decks of riding lawn mowers.\n\n\n2. Description of Related Art\n\n\nLawn mowers and trimmers have been around for many years. Lawn mowers can be made to be pushed by a user, or ridden on by a user. Lawn mowers and trimmers can be made to operate under the power of gas or electricity.\n\nTraditionally, the lawn mower and trimmer are two separate pieces of equipment, with two different intended functionalities. However, there are some combination lawn mower/trimmers. Usually, these combination lawn mower/trimmers are riding mowers in which the trimmer mechanism is either rigidly fixed to the mower deck of the lawn mower or attached to the mower deck by various hinges.\n\nAlthough great strides have been made in the area of lawn mowers and trimmers, many shortcomings remain.\n",

    "description": "\n\nTECHNICAL FIELD OF THE INVENTION\n\n\nThe present invention relates to a turf cutting machine.\n\nMore particularly, the present invention relates to a four-wheel drive turf cutting machine.\n\n\nBACKGROUND ART\n\n\nTurf cutting machines are known from the art, which machines are used to remove an old layer of turf in order to lay down a new layer of turf, or to cut a layer of turf that has to be transplanted to another place.\n\nTurf cutting machines allow to build and renovate gardens in just a few hours, and also to repair existing turfgrasses, such as for example football fields or tennis courts.\n\nTurf cutting machines can also be used to temporarily remove a strip of turf in order to perform an excavation (for example during a cable and/or pipe laying operation).\n\nIn general, a turf cutting machine comprises a frame which is mounted on a pair of front wheels and a pair of rear wheels and carries a motor and a cutting blade. The motor is used both to transmit motion to the wheels and to transmit motion to the cutting blade, which moves with an oscillating alternating motion to dig the ground and cut the turf.\n\nThe distance of the cutting blade from the ground must be adjustable to allow selection of the depth at which said blade enters the ground and, consequently, the thickness of the cut turf. Since the rotation center of the cutting blade is fixed relative to the frame, the adjustment of the distance of said cutting blade from the ground is obtained by moving the axle of the front wheels (front axle) and the axle of the rear wheels (rear axle), which axles are movable relative to the frame thanks to the provision of an articulated parallel link hitch. In this way, the front wheels and the rear wheels can move up and down parallel to the rotation center of the cutting blade, which results in the distance of the cutting blade from the ground being varied.\n\nUsually, turf cutting machines have two driving wheels, namely the two rear wheels.\n\nIn some cases, said rear drive wheels are replaced by a rear drive roller; however, this solution has the drawback that the rear roller passes over the freshly cut turf, with the risk of damaging it.\n\nIn general, the cutting blade is arranged within the wheel track and very often it happens that, due to the resistance encountered by the blade during cutting and to the humidity of the grass, the two driving wheels slip and the machine does not advance.\n\nConsequently, the operator has to place one foot on the frame of the machine and push it to help it move forward.\n\nThis operation, besides being uncomfortable and tiring, entails risks for the operator, who runs the risk of falling or suffering muscle sprains and/or strains.\n\nIn addition, uneven advancing of the turf cutting machine can also adversely affect the quality of the cut turf layer.\n\nThe object of the present invention is to overcome the drawbacks of the prior art, by providing a turf cutting machine which has improved traction and adhesion to the ground during operation, so as to avoid slippage on the ground and to guarantee a uniform forward movement of the machine itself.\n\nThis and other objects are achieved by means of a turf cutting machine as claimed in the appended claims.\n\n\nSUMMARY OF THE INVENTION\n\n\nThe invention overcomes the drawbacks of the prior art by providing a four-wheel drive turf cutting machine: four driving wheels allow to transmit a double driving force to the ground, thus facilitating the advancement of the turf cutting machine during operation.\n\nMaking a four-wheel drive turf cutting machine is not an obvious solution due to two main reasons mentioned above:\n\n\nBy way of example, a solution envisaging use of transmission shafts between the rear axle and the front axle would be practically impossible to implement due to the above-mentioned reasons.\n\nEven if a transmission belt is used, said transmission belt cannot directly connect two pulleys located on the front axle and, respectively, on the rear axle, since the distance between said axles varies when the distance of the cutting blade from the ground is varied, in particular when the axles are moved relative to the frame by means of the articulated parallel link hitch.\n\nIn addition, a transmission belt directly connecting two pulleys located on the front axle and, respectively, on the rear axle would risk to interfere with the cutting blade and its driving system.\n\nAccording to the invention, the motion is transmitted from the rear axle to the front axle (or vice versa) by means of a transmission arrangement which includes a transmission belt, a pulley mounted on the rear axle, a pulley mounted on the front axle, and a plurality of deflection pulleys which are arranged so as to define a path for the transmission belt that goes from the rear axle to the front axle and then back to the rear axle passing over the cutting blade and its driving system.\n\nPreferably said deflection pulleys are idler pulleys.\n\nIn a preferred embodiment of the invention, said deflection pulleys, together with the pulleys mounted on the rear and front axles, define a path for the transmission belt which schematically has the shape of an inverted âUâ, with a horizontal section arranged above the cutting blade and vertical sections joining respective ends of said horizontal section to respective axles.\n\nMore precisely, taking into account the fact that the path of the transmission belt forms a closed loop, it defines a double inverted âUâ, a first inverted âUâ going from the rear axle to the front axle, and a second inverted âUâ going from the front axle back to the rear axle. In a particularly preferred embodiment of the invention, the arrangement of the deflection pulleys takes into account the variation of the axle spacing when the distance of the cutting blade from the ground is varied.\n\nIn other words, the arrangement of the deflection pulleys is such that the length or perimeter of the path of the transmission belt defined by said deflection pulleys, together with the pulleys mounted on the rear and front axles, does not vary when the distance of the cutting blade from the ground is varied.\n\nFor this purpose, said deflection pulleys are mounted on the same support of the pulley of the rear axle or on the same support of the pulley of the front axle, so that the pulleys move together when the axles are moved to vary the distance of the cutting blade from the ground. This arrangement allows to obtain undeniable advantages.\n\nFirstly, it allows to keep the tension of the transmission belt constant.\n\nSecondly, it avoids any slipping of the front wheels on the ground when the lever for adjusting the distance of the cutting blade from the ground is actuated; such a slip would represent an important drawback as the actuation of the lever would become extremely tiring, since the driving torque would be generated on one axle only.\n",

    "description": "\n\nBACKGROUND\n\n\nThe present disclosure relates to a seeding and planting system and more particularly to a metering and distribution system of the seeding and planting system.\n\n\nSUMMARY\n\n\nCurrent seeding practices tend to involve one of two types of seeding systems: planters and air seeders. Planters generally singulate or individually meter seeds prior to planting and are typically used to disperse seeds where precise placement is required for maximum yield and the seeding rate permits use of singulating technologies. Air seeders generally meter seeds volumetrically and are typically used in high rate seeding applications and where precise seed placement is of less importance or not practical due to the high rates.\n\nA product distribution system includes a product on demand pick-up assembly including a hopper. The hopper is configured such that an air stream flowing into the pick-up assembly entrains product therein and conveys product downstream through a plurality of conduits. The product distribution system further includes a container for storing product prior to delivery of product to the pick-up assembly and a meter and conveyor assembly configured to move product from the container to the pick-up assembly hopper such that an amount of product greater than a predetermined quantity is maintained in the pick-up assembly hopper during operation of the system.\n\nA product on demand nozzle assembly includes an array of vertically spaced nozzles, each nozzle having an air inlet, an air and entrained product outlet, and an entrainment zone there between which is open from above to receive product therein to be distributed.\n\nA distribution system comprises a product on demand pick-up assembly including a hopper, the hopper configured such that an air stream flowing into the product on demand pick-up assembly entrains product therein and conveys product downstream through a plurality of conduits. Each tower of a plurality of pneumatic distribution towers is located downstream of an associated conduit of the plurality of conduits, and each pneumatic distribution tower includes an inlet extending upwards to a plurality of radially spaced outlets.\n\nOther features and aspects of the disclosure will become apparent by consideration of the following detailed description and accompanying drawings.\n",

    "description": "\n\nCROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION\n\n\nThis application claims the benefit of U.K. Application No. GB 1918843.2, filed Dec. 19, 2019, which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety.\n\n\nBACKGROUND\n\n\n\nField\n\n\nThe present invention relates to a mower combination comprising an agricultural vehicle and a number of mowing units suitable for generating swathes of cut crop, and in particular to a mowing apparatus for cutting a standing crop such as hay.\n\n\nDescription of Related Art\n\n\nIt is known to provide a mower combination in which a first mower unit is located ahead of an agricultural vehicle such as a tractor with two further lateral mowing units trailing the agricultural vehicle. The rear mowing units are provided with conveyor units for depositing cut crop into a swath or swathes behind the agricultural vehicle.\n\nIt is known for an operator to adjust the conveyors units to change the configuration of the swaths produced, for example to change from a single broad triple width swath to a double width swath accompanied by a single width swath or to a set of three single width swaths (and to have different spacings of such single width swaths depending upon the operation of the conveyor units). In the case of a first journey producing a double width swath accompanied by a single width swath, it will be understood that a second return journey will produce a set of three double width swaths.\n\nFor example depending upon the subsequent treatment of the cut crop different widths of swath may be appropriate. It may be that a loader wagon will collect cut crop from a broader swath, but that a baler requires a narrower swath. Thus an operator will wish to control the swath pattern produced for each set of cut crop to be processed.\n\nHowever, the need to constantly monitor and adjust the settings of the conveyor units to produce multiple swaths of the desired configurations throughout the working of multiple fields of varying shapes and sizes is stressful and tiring for the operator of the mower combination.\n\n\nSUMMARY\n\n\nAccording to a first aspect of the present invention, a mower combination comprises an agricultural vehicle and a number of mowing units suitable for cutting a standing crop connected to the agricultural vehicle, including a front mowing unit and two lateral mowing units located behind and to the sides of the front mowing unit, each of the lateral mowing units being provided with conveyor units to deposit the cut crop as a swath, the mower combination further comprising a control unit receiving a plurality of signals, the signals representing the location of the mower combination, a displacement of each of the conveyor units and a direction of operation of each of the conveyor units, the control unit being configured to receive the plurality of signals and compare the signals for the location of the mower combination, the displacement of the conveyor units and/or the direction of operation of the conveyor units against a predetermined set of values and as required to adjust the displacement or direction of operation of at least one conveyor unit based on this comparison.\n\nThis has as an advantage that the operator no longer needs constantly to monitor the operation of the conveyor units thereby reducing the stress and tiredness of the operator.\n\nPreferably, the predetermined set of values includes a desired track line and desired displacement or direction of operation of each conveyor unit.\n\nPreferably the conveyor units comprise conveyor belts or conveyor screws.\n\nPreferably, the mower combination further comprises a user terminal coupled to the control unit, the user terminal providing feedback to an operator of the adjustment of the displacement or direction of operation of the at least one of the conveyor units.\n\nPreferably the user terminal is used to provide the desired predetermined values for the displacement of the conveyor units and the direction of operation of the conveyor units in relation to the location of the mower combination.\n\nAccording to second aspect of the invention, a method of operation of a mower combination in accordance with the first aspect of the invention comprises providing a predetermined set of values to the control unit, monitoring the location of the mower combination, the displacement of each of the conveyor units and a direction of operation of each of the conveyor units and providing signals representative of the location of the mower combination and the direction of operation of the conveyor units to the control unit, the control unit comparing the signals representing the location of the mower combination, the displacement of each of the conveyor units and the direction of operation of the conveyor units against the predetermined set of values and as required signalling at least one conveyor unit to adjust the displacement or the direction of operation of the at least one conveyor unit based on this comparison.\n\nPreferably, the step of providing the predetermined set of values to the control unit is performed by an operator entering the predetermined set of values into the user terminal.\n\nAlternatively, the step of providing the predetermined set of values to the control unit is performed by an operator entering the predetermined set of values into a remote computing device in communication with the control unit.\n\nAlternatively, the step of providing the predetermined set of values to the control unit is performed by an operator entering a first set of the predetermined set of values into a remote computing device in communication with the control unit and a second set of the predetermined set of values into the user terminal.\n\nAccording to a third aspect of the invention, a computer implemented method comprises the steps of a control unit receiving a plurality of signals, the signals representing the location of the mower combination, a displacement of each of the conveyor units and a direction of operation of each of the conveyor units, the control unit being configured to receive the plurality of signals and compare the signals for the location of the mower combination and the displacement and/or direction of operation of each conveyor unit against a predetermined set of values and as required to adjust the displacement or direction of operation of at least one conveyor unit based on this comparison.\n\nAccording to a fourth aspect of the present invention, a computer readable program comprises instructions that causes one or more processors to implement the method of the third aspect of the invention.\n",

    "description": "\n\nBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION\n\n\nThe present invention pertains to agricultural harvesting machines and, more specifically, to a roll-type conditioner for an agricultural harvesting machine.\n\nAgricultural harvesting machines may include self-propelled windrowers or pull-type mower conditioners. Farmers may operate such mowing devices to cut crop material, such as hay or grass, from a field and subsequently deposit the cut crop into windrows on the field. The windrows may be left on the field to dry out the crop in the sun. Thereafter, farmers may bale the cut crop material with a baler, such as a large square baler or round baler, which straddles the windrows and travels along the windrows to pick up the crop material and form it into bales.\n\nA typical self-propelled windrower includes a chassis, a prime mover, wheels, and a detachable header. The header generally includes a cutter bar and a conditioner assembly. The cutter bar can be a rotary cutter bar with rotating discs or a sickle-type cutter bar with reciprocating knives.\n\nA typical pull-type mower conditioner includes a frame, a hitch coupled to the towing vehicle, a cutter bar, and a conditioner assembly. The mower conditioner may further include other elements such as a reel to assist crop feeding and an auger or belts to convey crop to a central discharge point.\n\nA conditioner assembly of a self-propelled windrower or pull-type mower conditioner generally includes two or more conditioning rolls for conditioning the crop material. The conditioning rolls are located adjacent to one another such that a gap forms therebetween. This gap in between the paired conditioning rolls helps to define the size of the crop mat which passes therethrough. As the crop passes through this gap, the conditioning rolls apply opposing tangential forces that condition or otherwise crush the crop material. The extent of conditioning is based in part on the size of the gap and the tension holding the conditioning rolls in place. Overtime, the surface of the conditioning rolls will wear, thus increasing the size of the gap and causing suboptimal conditioning of the crop material. As can be appreciated, suboptimal conditioning may negatively impact the drying time of the cut crop, tonnage, and/or feed quality.\n\nCurrent conditioning assemblies require an operator to manually set the gap size and tension of the conditioning rolls. The gap size can be set by adjusting a nut on a limiting rod coupled to one of the conditioning rolls. The tension can be set by turning a crank that variably biases one conditioning roll toward the other conditioner roll. However, it may be difficult for the operator to manually adjust these parameters, especially if certain components have become corroded or stuck due to crop buildup. Also, such adjustments may not be able to be accurately verified since the operator may not be able to visually inspect the gap size or roll tension. Thereby, the manual adjustment of the conditioning rolls can be difficult, time-consuming, and potentially inaccurate.\n\nWhat is needed in the art is a cost-effective and automatically adjustable crop conditioner.\n\n\nSUMMARY OF THE INVENTION\n\n\nIn one exemplary embodiment formed in accordance with the present invention, there is provided a crop conditioning device that generally includes at least two conditioning rolls, a tension mechanism, a roll-gap mechanism, and a controller operably connected to the tension and roll-gap mechanisms. The controller automatically sets an initial tension force and an initial roll gap dependent upon one or more of a crop material characteristic and/or an operational setting. The controller may also actively monitor the tension force and roll gap and accordingly automatically adjust the tension force and roll gap.\n\nIn another exemplary embodiment formed in accordance with the present invention, there is provided a crop conditioning device for an agricultural harvesting machine. The crop conditioning device includes a frame, a first conditioning roll connected to the frame, and a second conditioning roll connected to the frame such that the second conditioning roll is movable relative to the first conditioning roll. The second conditioning roll is located at a distance away from the first conditioning roll for defining a roll gap in between the first conditioning roll and the second conditioning roll. The first conditioning roll and the second conditioning roll are configured for conditioning a crop material.

    "description": "\n\nFIELD OF THE INVENTION AND PRIOR ART\n\n\nThe present invention relates to a method for handling logs, wherein a portable, hand-held log marking tool is used for applying a code marking on a log. The invention also relates to a portable, hand-held log marking tool for use in such a method.\n\nFrom WO 99/23873 A1 is previously known a system enabling a rational forest harvesting. According to one aspect of this system, the forest harvesting is carried out by means of a harvesting machine comprising a vehicle and a harvesting arrangement mounted thereon, the vehicle being provided with a computer arrangement adapted to register quality and/or size concerning harvested logs. In connection with the felling of a tree, the position of the harvesting machine is determined, for instance by means of a GPS equipment, and a log obtained from the tree is marked by a marking device with a code by means of which the log is associable to the position information. The code applied on a log may be stored in a database associated with data concerning quality and/or size of the log in question. In this way, it will be possible to treat the logs as products having an identity of origin and it will thereby be possible to check that an individual log or a batch of logs is not originating from a nature reserve where felling of trees is prohibited.\n\nHowever, this previously known system requires that the felling of the trees is carried out be means of a harvesting machine, which is not always the case. There is a need for a similar solution which can be used for handling logs emanating from trees which have not been felled by means of a harvesting machine or at least not by means of a harvesting machine equipped with a marking device.\n\nIt is previously known to mark individual logs with transponders (see for instance U.S. Pat. No. 8,511,570 B2) or marker tags (see for instance U.S. Pat. No. 7,080,577 B2) which are fixed to the logs by means of a hand-held striking tool.\n\n\nSUMMARY OF THE INVENTION\n\n\nThe object of the present invention is to provide a new and favourable method for handling logs.\n\nAccording to the invention, this object is achieved by a method having the features defined herein.\n\nThe method according the present invention comprises the following steps:\n\n\nWith this method, it will be possible to establish the place of origin of a marked log by reading the code marking applied on the log. The code marking can also be utilized in order to follow the movement of the log from the felling to the final customer. An authenticated code verifies that the associated code marking was applied on the log in question within a given time interval (for instance in the order of 30-120 seconds) after the moment when the code was retrieved or generated and the position of the log marking tool was established, which implies that the log must have been in the vicinity of this position when the code marking was applied on the log by means of the log marking tool. The correctness of the position information associated with a specific code marking on a log is hereby verified.\n\nFurther advantageous features of the method according to the present invention will appear from the description following below.\n\nThe invention also relates to a log marking tool having the features defined herein in.\n\nFurther advantageous features of the log marking tool according to the present invention will appear from the description following below.\n",

    "description": "\n\nBACKGROUND\n\n\n\n1. Field\n\n\nThe present disclosure relates to vibration reduction of control levers of a working machine, and more specifically, to control levers of a zero-turn riding lawnmower.\n\n\n2. Description of Related Art\n\n\nWhen a work vehicle is employed for work such as mowing grass, the work often takes a prolonged period of time. Riding comfort and superiority/inferiority of operability of the work vehicle can affect the fatigue and/or discomfort experienced by the operator of the work vehicle.\n\nFor some work vehicles, a steering operation of wheels is effected by a pair of right and left control levers. Vibrations due to rotation of parts of the work vehicle, such as an engine, and/or mowing blade(s) can be transmitted to such control levers. These vibrations can cause fatigue and discomfort to the operator, especially over prolonged periods of time.\n\n\nSUMMARY\n\n\nIf sympathetic vibration (resonance) occurs in a control lever due to vibration of the other parts of the working machine (e.g., the engine), this can lead to increase of vibration of the lever which is transmitted to the operator. In addition, even when a spongy hand grip or handle is provided at a free end of the control lever, the vibration of the hand grip may not be suppressed favorably to prevent discomfort to the operator of the working machine.\n\nOne aspect of the present disclosure to reduce the unwanted vibration of the control levers is a control lever of a zero-turn mower which is powered by an engine (e.g., internal combustion engine). The control lever is configured to have a different (e.g., lower) natural frequency than an operating frequency (i.e., main operating frequency) of the engine of the mower. By differentiating the natural frequency of the control lever from the main operating frequency of the engine, resonance at the control lever can be reduced or avoided, which can reduce vibration of the control levers and improve operator comfort. In embodiments, the control levers are configured to reduce the vibration in the vertical direction ranging from about 20 Hz to about 200 Hz that propagate from the chassis(frame) to the control levers.\n\nA control lever in accordance with this aspect of the disclosure can include a tube having a mass and a length extending from a first end to a second end. The tube defines a lumen extending from the second end towards the first end of the tube. That is, the lumen is the duct or cavity defined by the tube. The control lever also includes a rod having a predetermined mass and a length extending from a first end to a second end. The rod is fixed to the tube and disposed in the lumen at a predetermined position with respect to the second end of the tube.\n\nIn embodiments, the mass of the rod is determined based at least on the mass of the tube and the main operating frequency of the working machine such that the control lever has a natural frequency that is different from (e.g., less than) than the main operating frequency of the working machine. The main operating frequency may be the frequency (60 Hz) corresponding to the main operating engine speed of the mower, such as 3600 rpm for a two-stroke, 4-cylinder engine.\n\nIn embodiments, the rod comprises a solid member having a Young's modulus greater than 100 GPa and having a density greater than 4 g/cm\n\nIn embodiments, the tube comprises a sidewall that defines a through-hole in communication with the lumen. The through-hole is configured to receive a stopper extending into the lumen to engage a first end of the rod when the rod is positioned at the predetermined position in the lumen of the tube.\n\nIn embodiments, at least a part of an outer surface of the rod is abutting on at least part of an inner surface of the tube. For example, in embodiments, the rod may have a diameter that is less a diameter of the lumen so that there is some gap or spacing therebetween when the rod and the tube are abutting.\n\nAnother aspect of the present disclosure is a zero-turn mower, which is powered by an engine having an operating frequency corresponding to an engine speed and which includes the control levers described above in accordance with an aspect of the present disclosure. The zero-turn mower includes a vehicle body, a pair of right and left driving wheels that movably support the vehicle body, and a pair of the afore-mentioned control levers pivotally coupled to the vehicle body. Each control lever has a first end and a second end. The first end of the control lever is pivotally coupled to the vehicle body and the second end is a free end. The control levers are configured to pivot about a horizontal axis extending in a vehicle body transverse direction and are capable of adjusting rotational speeds of the right and left driving wheels respectively. The control levers are also configured about a horizontal axis parallel with a vehicle body main direction, such that the control levers may pivoted to an âopenâ configuration to allow access to an operation station (which may include a seat, but may also include an operation station in which the operator is standing) by an operator, and pivoted to a âclosedâ position when the operator is ready to assume control of the machine.\n\nAnother aspect of the present disclosure is a method of manufacturing a control lever configured in accordance with the present disclosure. The method includes providing a tube extending from a first end to a second open end. The tube defines a lumen extending in a direction from the second open end toward the first end of the tube. Also, the method includes introducing a rod into the lumen of the tube through the second open end of the tube. The rod has a length extending from a first end to a second end. Also, the method includes positioning the rod in the lumen to a predetermined position with respect to the second end of the tube, and fixing the rod to the tube at the predetermined position.\n\nIn embodiments, when the rod is positioned at the predetermined position, the second end of the rod is flush with, recessed from, or protruding from the second open end of the tube. In embodiments, the method further comprises, before introducing the rod, inserting a stopper into the lumen through a hole defined in a wall of the tube in communication with the lumen. The stopper is configured to engage the first end of the rod when the rod is at the predetermined position. In embodiments, the method further includes, after securing the rod to the tube, removing the stopper from at least one of the hole in the wall of the tube and the lumen. In embodiments, fixing the rod to the tube includes welding the rod to the tube.\n\nIn embodiments, when the rod is in the predetermined position, the distance between the second end of the rod and the second end of the tube is 30 mm or less.\n\nIn accordance with another aspect of the disclosure, a control lever for maneuvering a zero-turn mower is provided. The zero-turn mower is powered by an engine having an operating frequency corresponding to an operating engine speed. The control lever includes a lateral portion having a first weight per unit length, and includes an upright portion coupled to the lateral portion. The upright portion has a second weight per unit length that is less than the first weight per unit length.\n",

    "description": "\n\nCROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION\n\n\nThis application claims the benefit of U.K. Application No. GB 1918849.9, filed Dec. 19, 2019, which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety.\n\n\nBACKGROUND\n\n\n\nField\n\n\nThe present invention relates to a mower combination comprising an agricultural vehicle and a number of mowing units suitable for generating swathes of cut crop, and in particular to a mowing apparatus for cutting a standing crop such as hay.\n\n\nDescription of Related Art\n\n\nIt is known to provide a mower combination in which a first mowing unit is located ahead of an agricultural vehicle such as a tractor with two further lateral mowing units trailing the agricultural vehicle. The rear mowing units can optionally be provided with conveyor units for depositing cut crop into a swath or swathes behind the agricultural vehicle.\n\nIn a first example, when directed in a straight line, the mower combination is configured to produce three separate aligned swathes of even width.\n\nWhen turning during a mowing operation, for example to avoid an obstacle, such as a tree or rock, the agricultural vehicle and the front mower turn at a different position to the towed rear mowing units. Thus, instead of three aligned swaths, the swaths produced by the towed rear mowing units become offset from the central swath. This uneven laying down of these swathes creates problems for a following apparatus, for example a self-propelled forage harvester which is to process the swath. These problems are worse if one or other of the swaths produced by the towed rear mowing units overlies the central swath.\n\nIn a second example, when directed in a straight line, the mower combination is configured to produce a single central swath. As noted, when turning while mowing, the agricultural vehicle and the front mower turn at a different position to the towed rear mowing units. In such a circumstance the swath may become uneven. This uneven laying down of these swathes creates problems for a subsequent apparatus, for example a baler or loader wagon which is to process the swath. Since the subsequent vehicle might not share the turning radius of the mower combination, it is a problem that the ground engaging wheels of the subsequent vehicle may run over and so damage the swath before it can be processed by the subsequent vehicle.\n\nIt is an advantage of the present invention that is seeks to address both of these problems.\n\n\nSUMMARY\n\n\nAccording to a first aspect of the present invention, a mower combination comprises an agricultural vehicle and three mowing units connected to the agricultural vehicle, the mowing units being suitable for cutting a standing crop and comprising a front mowing unit and two lateral mowing units located behind and to the sides of the front mowing unit, each of the lateral mowing units being provided with a conveyor unit to deposit the cut crop as a swath, the mower combination further comprising a control unit receiving a plurality of signals, the signals representing a steering angle and speed of the agricultural vehicle, as well as a speed of operation and a lateral displacement of each conveyor unit, the control unit being configured to receive the plurality of signals and compare the signals for the steering angle and speed of the agricultural vehicle, as well as the speed of operation and the lateral displacement of each conveyor unit against a predetermined set of values and as required to adjust the speed of operation of at least one conveyor unit based on this comparison.\n\nThis has as an advantage that the offset of the swaths produced by the towed rear mowing units is controlled, in particular the invention may enable aligned curved swaths or a single narrower central swath to be produced in the event that the mower combination is turned.\n\nPreferably, the control unit may additionally adjust the lateral displacement of the at least one conveyor unit based on the comparison. Alternatively, or additionally, the may additionally adjust the lateral displacement of tone of the lateral units based on the comparison.\n\nAccording to second aspect of the invention, a method of operation of a mower combination in accordance with the first aspect of the invention to produce three swathes of uniform width comprises providing a predetermined set of values to the control unit, monitoring the steering angle and speed of the agricultural vehicle, as well as the lateral displacement and speed of operation of each of the conveyor units and providing signals representative of the steering angle and speed of the agricultural vehicle, as well as the speed of operation and lateral displacement of the conveyor units to the control unit, the control unit comparing the signals representing for the steering angle and speed of the agricultural vehicle, as well as the speed and the lateral displacement of each conveyor unit against the predetermined set of values and as required signalling at least one conveyor unit to adjust the speed of operation of the at least one conveyor unit based on this comparison.\n\nAccording to third aspect of the invention, a method of operation of a mower combination in accordance with the first aspect of the invention to produce a single swath of narrow width comprises providing a predetermined set of values to the control unit, monitoring the steering angle and speed of the agricultural vehicle, as well as the lateral displacement and speed of operation of each of the conveyor units and providing signals representative of the steering angle and speed of the agricultural vehicle, as well as the speed of operation and lateral displacement of the conveyor units to the control unit, the control unit comparing the signals representing for the steering angle and speed of the agricultural vehicle, as well as the speed and the lateral displacement of each conveyor unit against the predetermined set of values and as required signalling at least one conveyor unit to adjust the speed of operation of the at least one conveyor unit based on this comparison.\n\nPreferably, the control unit may additionally adjust the lateral displacement of the at least one conveyor unit based on the comparison.\n\nPreferably, the control unit may additionally adjust the lateral displacement of at least one of the lateral mowing units based on the comparison.\n\nAccording to a fourth aspect of the invention, a computer implemented method comprises the steps of a control unit receiving a plurality of signals, the signals representing the steering angle and speed of an agricultural vehicle, as well as a lateral displacement and a speed of operation of each of a pair of conveyor units, the control unit being configured to receive the plurality of signals and compare the signals for the steering angle and speed of the agricultural vehicle, as well as the speed and the lateral displacement of each conveyor unit against a predetermined set of values and as required to adjust the speed of operation of at least one conveyor unit based on this comparison.\n\nPreferably, the control unit may additionally adjust the lateral displacement of the at least one conveyor unit based on the comparison.\n\nPreferably, the control unit may additionally adjust the lateral displacement of at least one of the lateral mowing units based on the comparison.\n\nAccording to a fifth aspect of the present invention, a computer readable program comprises instructions that causes one or more processors to implement the method of the second or third aspects of the invention.\n",

More specifically, the present description relates to automatic positioning guidance for a vehicle being positioned relative to an agricultural commodity cart.\n\n\nBACKGROUND\n\n\nAgricultural operations such as planting, harvesting, and applying agricultural product (e.g., fertilizer, pesticide, herbicide, etc.) are typically subject to time constraints. Moreover, even in the absence of pressing time deadlines, efficient agricultural operations should be done relatively quickly.\n\nOne time-consuming agricultural operation is the loading/unloading of agricultural material to/from an agricultural commodity cart. Efforts have been made to move significant quantities of material to/from the commodity cart quickly. However, there remain opportunities for reducing the time spent interacting with a commodity cart. To the extent that time spent on commodity cart interaction can be reduced, overall agricultural efficiency can be increased.\n\n\nSUMMARY\n\n\nA commodity cart includes at least one storage tank and a transfer arm having a product chute, a tube portion coupled to the product chute. The tube portion ends in a product outlet.

    "description": "\n\nFIELD OF THE INVENTION\n\n\nThis invention relates to vegetation wall systems. More particularly, the invention is directed to a vegetation wall system capable of monitoring at least one aspect of the system for anomalous conditions.\n\n\nBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION\n\n\nThis section provides background information related to the present disclosure which is not necessarily prior art.\n\nBuilt environments, such as commercial buildings, offices, retail stores, factories, urban infrastructure, and homes, have effects on the wellbeing, productivity and mood of its occupants. Adding plants and light to built environments can greatly improve the wellbeing, profitability, work productivity and air quality of their occupants. Plants provide cleaner air by absorbing carbon dioxide in the surrounding environment. However, the disbursement of plants requires maintenance. To survive, plants require adequate heat, light, water, and fertilizer. Further, sparsely placed, potted plants may not provide adequate coverage for a built environment.\n\nPlant walls may provide more coverage for built environments. However, they also require significant maintenance. Surface temperature, light illumination, flow rate, water composition, and water level are just some of the important features of plant life and health. Currently, plant owners and maintainers must constantly monitor these variables and respond to the system when one or more of these features is not operating optimally.\n\nA need exists for a self-maintaining, aesthetically pleasing device for growing plants in built environments.\n\n\nSUMMARY OF THE INVENTION\n\n\nThese and other advantages and novel features of the present invention, as well as details of illustrated aspects thereof, will be more fully understood from the following description and the figures.\n\nIt is to be understood that both the preceding general description and the following detailed description describe various aspects and are intended to provide an overview or framework for understanding the nature and character of the claimed subject matter.

    "description": "\n\nTECHNICAL FIELD\n\n\nThis disclosure relates to a raking device, and in some implementations, a detachable rake head for raking sand traps and its method of use.\n\n\nBACKGROUND\n\n\nIn the sport of golf, one kind of hazard frequently encountered by golfers is the sand trap. A sand trap may be a depression or carve out that is commonly filled with sand or similar material. When a golfer hits a ball out of a sand trap, the golfer will usually disturb the surface of the sand, both through striking the ball as well as walking to and from the spot of the shot. These perturbations in the surface of the sand may make shots by other subsequent golfers more difficult, and as such, it is a common courtesy in golf to rake the surface of the sand trap smooth after the golfer has completed their shot and exited the sand trap.\n\nTraditionally, golf courses would usually provide rakes at the site of sand traps for golfers to use to rake the sand smooth. However, some golf courses removed these courtesy rakes in an effort to help prevent the spread of microbes or viruses, especially during times of a pandemic. Some golf courses have asked golfers to attempt to smooth the surface of sand traps using a golf club or the side of the golfer's shoe. However, these approaches generally have not produced the same smooth surface that raking the sand trap would have provided, thus leaving the sand traps in sub-optimal conditions for other golfers. Although a golfer could carry their own personal rake to avoid contamination concerns, golfers rarely do so, as traditional rakes are large and not adapted to fit in golf bags or otherwise be easily transported around the golf course, especially when the golfer is walking and carrying their golf clubs. Further, storing a rake in close proximity to golf clubs and a golf bag may risk the sharp parts of the rake contacting the golf equipment and scratching or otherwise damaging the equipment.\n\n\nSUMMARY\n\n\nSome embodiments described herein include an improved detachable raking device with extendable rake tines. In some embodiments, the improved raking device may be configured to be releasably attached to a supporting handle (e.g., a broom handle, golf club, golf ball retriever, or other rod-typed structure). Optionally, the raking device may include a c-shaped support tube and a releasable clamp for securing the raking device to the supporting handle. Thus, should the user prefer to transport and store the raking device in a golf bag or pocket when not in use, the user may advantageously re-attach the raking device to the supporting handle, such as another golf club, ball retriever, or similar device, when encountering a sand trap. Optionally the detachable raking device may be used for raking other surfaces besides sand traps, such as gardens, pebbles, and other sand or granular media features. In other embodiments, other types of attachment mechanisms may be used, such as twist-to-lock friction fittings, screw-type clamps, quick release, or other attachment media. Similarly, in some embodiments a cylinder may be used in place of the c-shaped support tube, or the c-shaped support tube may be replaced with a series of c-shaped clamps in other embodiments.\n\nIn some embodiments, the raking device further includes collapsible rake head arms. In such embodiments, during storage and transport, the collapsible rake hard arms are retracted and positioned parallel to the raking device body (and supporting handle, if attached). When the user desires to use the raking device, the user may rotate the rake head arms to a position perpendicular to the raking device body (and supporting handle, if attached). When the user has finished using the raking device, the user may rotate the rake head arms back into the collapsed position. In this manner, when in the stored position, the raking device is compact and easily transportable in a golf bag, or if detached from the supporting handle, in a pocket or clipped to the side of the bag. Likewise, the raking device may easily and quickly be extended to the open position when the user needs to rake a sand trap.\n\nIn certain embodiments the rake head arms are manually extendable by the user from the collapsed to the extended position, and vice versa. In particular implementations, the rake head arms may include a twist-to-lock mechanism for securing the rake head arms in the extended position, such that they do not fall or are not pushed back into the collapsed position during raking. In other embodiments, the raking device may include a manual slider, lever, or spring-loaded deployment mechanism for automatically extending the rake head arms. For example, the rake head device may optionally include a rake head arm extension button mechanically coupled to the rake head arms by one or more coil springs. In such embodiments, when the user depresses the rake head arm extension button, the tension in the coil spring is released, driving the rake head arms from the collapsed to the extended position. In some embodiments, the coil springs may interact with a rotational cable to rotate the rake head arms and lock them in place as they are rotated to the extended position.\n\nIn some embodiments, a slider may also be included on the raking device that is driven from a first position to a second position by the coil spring(s), and a second, retractions button on the raking device. In these embodiments, when the user desires to return the rake head arms from the extended to collapsed position, the user may depress the retraction button and pull down on the slider. This will release the twist-to-lock mechanism and pull on the rotational cable and coil springs, rotating the rake head arms back from the extended to the collapsed position. Then, the slider may lock back in the first position, placing the coil springs in a tensed position and readying the raking device for subsequent deployment the next time the user encounters a sand trap and needs to extend the rake head arms.\n\nOptionally, the rake head arms may further comprise extendable raking tines. In such embodiments, when the rake head arms are in the collapsed position, the raking tines are retracted into the rake head arms, thereby reducing the risk that the raking device will cause damage to other golf equipment or inadvertently harm the user. When the rake head arms are rotated to the extended position, the raking tines are also extended from the rake head arms so that the user may use the rake to fix the surface of a sand trap. In some embodiments, the rotation of the rake head arms to the extended and locked position automatically causes extension of the raking tines (e.g., through rotation of the twist-to-lock mechanism securing the extendable rake head arms to the rest of the raking device). Likewise, when the user rotates the rake head arms into the collapsed position, the raking tines may be automatically retracted into the rake head arms by the reverse operation of the twist-to-lock mechanism. In other embodiments, the raking tines may be manually extended through, for example, a second slider on the raking device, or rotational collars on the rake head arms themselves.\n\nParticular embodiments described herein include a rake device having a rake body having a lock collar slot. Some embodiments may further optionally comprise a plurality of extendable rake heads hingedly coupled to the rake body with a plurality of raking tine apertures and a plurality of extendable raking tines. In some embodiments, the extendable raking tines extend through the plurality of raking tine apertures in response to rotation of the extendable rake heads from a first position substantially parallel to a major axis of the rake body to a second position substantially perpendicular to the major axis of the rake body. Optionally, the rake device may include a rotatable lock collar coupled to the extendable rake heads and positioned to mate with the lock collar slot responsive to said rotation of the extendable rake heads to the second position.\n\nSome embodiments may include a method of raking a granular surface comprising method of raking a granular material comprising inserting a supporting handle into a detachable rake device, the rake device having a rake body with a lock collar slot. In some embodiments, the method may further optionally include the step of extending a plurality of extendable rake heads hingedly coupled to the rake body from a first position substantially parallel to a major axis of the rake body to a second position substantially perpendicular to the major axis of the rake body. In some implementations, the method may further include extending a plurality of extendable raking tines through a plurality of raking tine apertures, wherein the extendable raking tines extend through the plurality of raking tine apertures in response to rotation of the extendable rake heads. Optionally, the method may include the step of engaging a rotatable lock collar coupled to the extendable rake heads with the lock collar slot in response to said rotation of the extendable rake heads to the second position and raking a granular surface.\n\nA number of embodiments described herein may provide one or more of the following advantages. First, some embodiments provide a detachable raking device that may be carried by a golfer and releasably attached to a supporting arm, such as a broom handle or other golf club, broom handle, ball retriever, or other supporting device when the user needs to rake a sand trap. This allows the user to maintain the surface of the sand trap while avoiding the use of communal rakes that may pose a risk for the spread of microbes, viruses, or other disease-causing germs. Second, the raking device may comprise in some embodiments collapsible rake head arms that may be extended from a collapsed position for transport, to an extended position for use. This allows the user to carry the raking device in a golf bag in a compact manner and extend the rake head arms only when the user needs to use the rake, such as at a sand trap. Third, particular embodiments of the raking device may include extendable raking tines, which are retracted into the rake head arms during transport and only extended when the rake head arms are placed in the extended position for use. These extendable tines reduce the chance that the raking device (and its tines) will cause damages to other golf equipment or the user's golf bag during transport, and similarly reduces the chance that the raking tines would catch on or scratch the user.\n\nThe details of one or more embodiments are set forth in the accompanying drawings and the description below. Other features, objects, and advantages will be apparent from the description and drawings, and from the claims.\n",

    "description": "\n\nBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n\nField of the Invention\n\n\nThe disclosure relates to a twine knotter for forming two knots in a pair of twine strands, the twine knotter comprising a drive pulley driven intermittently rotatably about a drive axis and a bill hook rotatably driven by the drive pulley about a knotter axis to form two successive knots in the pair of twine strands by two complete rotations of the bill hook in one rotation of the drive pulley. Further, the twine knotter comprises a twine holding device for clamping the pair of twine strands between a first clamping element and a second clamping element of the twine holding device rotatably driven by the drive pulley, and a twine knife for severing the pair of twine strands.\n\n\nBackground\n\n\nTwine knotters or tying machines are mainly used in mobile packing presses for the formation of bundles of straw, hay, silage and similar materials as well as in the use of recyclable materials, for example for bundling paper, textiles, thin sheet metal and the like. Binding or bundling equipment fitted with such twine knotters may also form part of packaging machinery for strapping packages, bales or bundles of other materials suitable for this purpose.\n\nIn stationary or mobile pack presses, the material to be pressed is compacted in a pressing channel, which is usually rectangular in cross-section, and pressed into a rectangular material strand. The material strand is divided into cuboidal packsâthe term square bales is also commonly usedâwhose top and bottom sides and their outer sides are strapped with several twine strands in the longitudinal direction of the baling channel, which are knotted before the pack is ejected.\n\nEP 1 745 691 B1 discloses several twine knotters driven together by one knotter shaft. Each twine knotter has a drive disk which is mounted on the knotter shaft and is connected to it in a rotationally fixed manner. The drive pulley has a plurality of toothing sections over partial circumferences that mesh with pinions of drive components, such as the bill hook and the rotatable clamping element of the twine holding device, to rotationally drive them. The toothing sections are combined into two groups of toothing sections that each serve to form one of the two knots. The toothing sections of one group are arranged on different diameters and offset to each other over the circumference. The pinions of the drive components are also offset from each other over the circumference and arranged on the diameter of the respective toothing section. The toothing sections for driving the twine holding device are arranged in such a way in the direction of rotation of the drive pulley leading to the toothing sections driving the bill hook that when a knot is formed the twine holding device starts to rotate before the bill hook.\n\nWith this arrangement, two knots can be tied in one full rotation of the drive pulley. Twine holding devices with a driver and a twine holder are used. The driver is made of several driver discs arranged at a distance from each other, between which a comb-like twine holder engages. The driver is driven in rotation about a driver axis, which is aligned approximately in the direction in which the twine is fed to the knotter. The twine is then clamped between the driver and the twine holder.\n\nA disadvantage of the described state-of-the-art twine knotter is that a twine waste is created between the formation of two knots, which twine residue is not knotted to the pair of twine strands at the bundle and falls loosely onto the bundle as waste.\n\n\nSUMMARY OF THE INVENTION\n\n\nOne aspect of the present disclosure is to provide a twine knotter and a method for forming knots by avoiding twine waste.\n\nTherefore, the twine knotter comprising a drive pulley driven intermittently rotatably about a drive axis and a bill hook rotatably driven by the drive pulley about a knotter axis to form two successive knots in the pair of twine strands by two complete rotations of the bill hook in one rotation of the drive pulley. Further, the twine knotter comprises a twine holding device for clamping the pair of twine strands between a first clamping element and a second clamping element of the twine holding device rotatably driven by the drive pulley, and a twine knife for severing the pair of twine strands. The rotatable second clamping element of the twine holding device is driven rotatably about a twine holder axis by the drive pulley in such a way that the rotatable second clamping element completes two rotations for one rotation of the drive pulley. Further, the twine holder axis and the knotter axis form an angle of less than 45Â° with each other when viewed in the direction of the drive axis.\n\nIn this twine knotter in the form of a double knotter, in which two knots are tied in one full rotation of the drive pulley, a rotatable second clamping element of the twine holding device is used, which, in contrast to known twine knotters, is driven rotatably about a twine holder axis which encloses an angle of less than 45Â° with the knotter axis. The twine holder axis is arranged transversely to the feed direction of the pair of twine strands. In this design of twine knotter, in which the rotatable second clamping element of the twine holding device completes two full rotations for one full rotation of the drive pulley, the twine knife pulls the pair of twine strands out of the twine holding device after the formation of the second knot without severing them. This is achieved by fully rotating the rotatable second clamping element at the time when the twine knife reaches the pair of twine strands after forming the second knot. Because then the pair of twine strands is no longer clamped in the twine holding device and can be pulled out of the twine holding device by the twine knife.\n\nAnother advantage is that the bill hook is rotationally driven in the same direction for both knots, so that both knots are knotted in the same direction. Preferably, a twisted twine is used, which is, at the predetermined direction of rotation of the bill hook, slightly untwisted against the twisting direction of the twine. The fact that there is no twine waste during knot formation means that a longer twine end is available when the loop is pulled off over the bill hook for forming the knot. This allows two loop knots to be tied one after the other, which are stronger than pulled-through knots.\n\nIn this arrangement, in an exemplary embodiment of the twine knotter, the twine holder axis and the knotter axis may form an angle of less than 40Â° with each other, in particular less than 35Â°, when viewed in the direction of the drive axis.\n\nFurther, in an exemplary embodiment of the twine knotter, the twine holder axis and the knotter axis may include an angle of more than 15Â° with each other, particularly more than 20Â°, when viewed in the direction of the drive axis.\n\nThe twine holder axis may intersect or cross the drive axis at a distance, which is less than an outside diameter of the drive pulley.\n\nAccording to an exemplary embodiment, the twine knotter may further comprise a knot pull-off arm, for pulling off a first loop in the pair of twine strands and forming the first knot after a full rotation of the bill hook. Thus, a loop for forming a knot can be actively pulled off the bill hook to ensure a safe formation of a knot.\n\nA twine knife for severing the pair of twine strands may be disposed on the knot pull-off arm, such that during or after the loop is pulled off to form the first knot, the pair of twine strands may be severed.\n\nAlternatively, the twine knife may be disposed on the rotatable second clamping element of the twine holding device so that severing of the pair of twine strands may be performed independently of pulling off the loop to form the first knot.\n\nThe first clamping element of the twine holding device can be stationary. The stationary first clamping element and the rotatable second clamping element of the twine holding device each may have a recess, running radially with respect to the twine holder axis, for receiving the pair of twine strands.\n\nThe first clamping element and the rotatable second clamping element of the twine holding device may each have clamping surfaces facing each other for clamping the pair of twine strands. The clamping surfaces facing each other in the direction of the twine holder axis can be conical and complementary to each other. The clamping surfaces facing each other can also be flat, for example at a right angle to the twine holder axis.\n\nTo drive the second clamping element of the twine holding device, the drive pulley may have two twine holder toothing sections, each extending partially circumferentially about the drive axis and having the same radial distance from the drive axis. To drive the bill hook, the drive pulley may have two bill hook toothing sections, each extending partially circumferentially about the drive axis and having the same radial distance from the drive axis.\n\nWhen the drive pulley is rotationally driven, at corresponding rotational angle ranges, the twine holder teeth sections come into overlap with a pinion of the second clamping element of the twine holding device to mesh therewith and thereby drive it. On a different radius, in corresponding rotational angle ranges, the bill hook toothing sections come into overlap with a pinion of the bill hook to mesh therewith and drive it.\n\nThe twine holder toothing sections and the bill hook toothing sections are divided into groups of one twine holder toothing section and one bill hook toothing section, respectively, to form one of the two knots. In this case, the groups of toothing sections are arranged offset from each other in the circumferential direction so that the second clamping element and the bill hook are each intermittently driven twice in succession during one rotation of the drive pulley to form two knots in succession.\n\nThe twine holder toothing sections and the bill hook toothing sections may each be spaced at different distances from the drive axis.\n\nAlternatively, it may be provided that each of the twine holder toothing section and the bill hook toothing section of a group of toothing sections for forming one of the knots is formed by a common toothing section. This means that the twine holder toothing sections and the bill hook toothing sections are arranged at the same distance from the drive axis. Accordingly, the two toothing sections each serve to drive both the second clamping element of the twine holding device and the bill hook. The common toothing sections are offset from each other around the circumference.\n\nA method for forming two knots in a twine by means of a twine knotter described above comprises the following method sequence:\n\n\nIn that, after at least partial rotation of the bill hook and at least partial formation of the loop for the second knot, the pair of twine strands clamped in the twine holding device is released by rotation of the rotatable clamping element, it is ensured that the twine knife can no longer sever the pair of twine strands. Rather, the pair of twine strands is pulled out of the released twine holding device by the twine knife. In this way, a twine waste is avoided.\n\nCutting the pair of twine strands after forming the second knot may be accomplished by continuing to rotate the rotatable second clamping element, with the twine knife arranged on the rotatable second clamping element and cutting the pair of twine strands.\n\nPulling off the first loop to form the first knot, and pulling off the second loop to form the second knot, may be accomplished by moving a knot pull-off arm.\n\nThe cutting of the twine pair can also be done by means of a twine knife on the knot pull-off arm when pulling the loop off the bill hook. In this case, no twine knife is arranged on the rotatable second clamping element. Alternatively, the pair of twine strands can be cut by a stationary twine knife on a knotter frame.\n\nIn an exemplary embodiment of the method, it may be provided that the first clamping element is stationary and, like the rotatable second clamping element, has a recess extending radially relative to the twine holder axis for receiving the pair of twine strands. To clamp the pair of twine strands after at least partial formation of the first loop, the rotatable second clamping element is rotated to a rotational position in which the recess of the rotatable second clamping element and the recess of the first clamping element are oriented in overlapping relationship with one another. The pair of twine strands is then fed into the recesses of the two clamping elements and finally the rotatable second clamping element is rotated further until the pair of twine strands is clamped between the clamping surfaces of the clamping elements.\n\nAfter cutting the pair of twine strands, the rotatable second clamping element can be further rotated until the rotational position at the beginning of the rotation is reached and the rotation is paused.\n",

    "description": "\n\nFIELD OF THE INVENTION\n\n\nThe invention relates to an agricultural baling system, particularly but not exclusively, comprising an agricultural baler implement. Other aspects of the present invention relate to an agricultural machinery, such as a combination of a tractor and a baler, a method of controlling an agricultural baler, the use of a flywheel to drive parts of the agricultural baling system.\n\n\nBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION\n\n\nBalers are well known in agriculture and are widely used to bale plant matter in fields into bales that may be conveniently and effectively handled, stored and used. Balers are known that bale forage products such as grass and other leaves used as hay or other types of animal feed; straw or other plant parts resulting as by-products from a harvesting operation such as combine harvesting; cotton; and other plant parts of commercial or other value.\n\nThe majority of balers in use in Europe are designed to be towed behind an agricultural tractor or another towing vehicle that, under the control of an operator and/or using operator-monitored software, moves the baler about a field and provides power to operate internal parts of the baler. The provision of power is effected by way of a rotatable power take-off (PTO) shaft connected to the rotary power take-off that typically is part of the tractor.\n\nKnown designs of agricultural baler include a pick-up, mounted at the front of the machine, that causes the ingestion of plant matter into the interior of the machine as it moves about a field. Differing internal designs of baler components are known in the part of the machine downstream of the pick-up.\n\nOne commonplace type of baler is often referred to as a ârectangular balerâ. This includes a cuboidal bale-forming chamber in which the ingested plant matter is compacted into a cuboidal shape by a piston or plunger that reciprocates longitudinally back and forth inside the bale-forming chamber between retracted and extended positions. Charges of plant matter repeatedly are fed into the bale-forming chamber from the pick-up by the mechanism of the baler. This action is timed with the motion of the plunger such that feeding of plant matter coincides with retraction of the plunger to one end of the bale-forming chamber. The plant matter then is compacted by subsequent extension strokes of the plunger along the bale-forming chamber.\n\nThe reciprocal rectilinear motion of the plunger is effected using a driveline that converts rotary drive derived from the rotating PTO shaft, connected to the baler above the pick-up, into reciprocal motion of the plunger. This typically is achieved by changing, in the driveline, the axis of the rotation from one parallel to the longitudinal length of the baler to an axis of rotation transverse thereto.\n\nSuch transverse-axis rotation is applied to a crank that is pivot-jointed to one end of a conrod the other end of which is pivot-jointed to the plunger, that is moveably captive inside the bale-forming chamber. As a result, rotation of the crank causes the reciprocal movement of the plunger.\n\nThe driveline between the power take-off of the tractor and the plunger includes a clutch that in a typical case is formed of two or more dry friction plates that are urged into mutual engagement by a hydraulic actuator or spring arrangement. Additionally a heavy flywheel (that in some baler designs weighs 600 kg or more) is secured to a rotatable shaft that defines or is connected to an input shaft in turn connected in use to the PTO shaft.\n\nThe flywheel is needed because the plunger during its motion is associated with very high, and highly varying, levels of power that might peak at 1500 Hp (about 1100 kW). In the absence of the flywheel it might be impossible for the rotary power take-off of a tractor to provide sufficient power to move the plunger, and very high forces might be transmitted back towards the tractor via the PTO shaft potentially causing damage to the baler or tractor or making the tractor-baler combination difficult to control.\n\nThe flywheel has high levels of inertia and, in order to prevent injuries, it is desirable to stop rotation of the flywheel as swiftly as possible once the PTO shaft has stopped providing power to the agricultural baler (e.g. when the tractor engine is turned off). Existing devices for stopping the flywheel without access to external power provided by the PTO shaft are dissatisfactory.\n\nThe invention seeks to solve or ameliorate one or more problems of prior art balers.\n\nEmbodiments of the invention are suitable for inclusion in all baler types and machinery combinations disclosed herein. The disclosure of embodiments or parts of embodiments herein includes their disclosure in combination with all baler types and machinery combinations herein, even if these are indicated as forming part of the prior art.\n\nThe terms âbaling machineâ and âbalerâ are used synonymously herein and in the art generally.\n\nThe term âpower take-offâ is synonymous with the acronym âPTOâ.\n\nThe term âtractorâ embraces a wide variety of machines potentially capable of towing a baler, as will be known to the person of skill in the art.\n\nThe term âclutchâ except as otherwise explained embraces any design of clutch that is suitable for transferring drive in the circumstances described.\n\nThe term âplant matterâ and derivatives potentially includes all types of matter that potentially may be ingested into a baler for the purpose of being formed into bales.\n\nThe terms âpistonâ and âplungerâ in the context of the principal, moveable, bale-forming part of a bale-forming chamber are used synonymously herein.\n\n\nSUMMARY OF THE INVENTION\n\n\nAspects and embodiments of the disclosure provide an agricultural baler, an agricultural machinery and a method for controlling an agricultural baler as claimed in the appended claims.\n\nAccording to a first aspect of the present disclosure, there is provided an agricultural system comprising an agricultural baler that comprises:\n\na rotary input shaft connectable by way of a baler driveline to a rotatable flywheel;\n\na hydraulic pump for supplying the agricultural baler with hydraulic fluid, the rotatable flywheel being connectable to the hydraulic pump via the driveline,\n\nwherein the baler is transferrable between a first state for driving the hydraulic pump by means of external drive power provided by a corresponding work vehicle, and a second state for driving the hydraulic pump by means of internal drive power, particularly provided by means of a rotatable flywheel,\n\nThe system further comprises a control unit that is configured to:\n\nreceive input-power-data indicative of a drive power available for driving the hydraulic pump in the first state of the baler;

    "description": "\n\nFIELD OF THE INVENTION\n\n\nThe present invention relates to the field of agriculture. In particular, the present invention relates to the production of plants with complex traits using tissue technology.\n\n\nBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION\n\n\nThe standard solution to enhance crop traits has been genetics and breeding. However, introducing a new trait in a commercially relevant variety by crossing (sexual hybridization) while maintaining (multigenomic and/or complex) commercially relevant traits such as fruit size and crop yield, requires a cumbersome and long term process or crossing and selection (introgression). Although genetic modification tools are available gaining a new trait in a relatively fast time span, these techniques are not widely accepted for modifying traits of (crop) plants. Therefore, there is a need for innovative, but commercially acceptable, ways to introduce traits in plants, in particular in crop plants.\n\n\nSolution Provided by the Present Invention\n\n\nThe present inventors were the first to produce a commercially relevant crop plant harbouring a new trait in a significantly reduced time span as compared to state of the art crossing and selection, without making use of genetic modification techniques. The present inventors reached this goal by making use of tissue technology in combination with classical breeding techniques. By making use of tissue technology, the present invention seriously reduces the amount of required backcrossings and/or selfings and linkage drag problems. In fact, the present invention allows the production of phenotypes that would otherwise not exist.\n\nIn dicotyledonous plants, three separate layers of cells (L1-, L2- and L3-shoot meristem layer) are usually present in a shoot meristem. These separate shoot meristem layers result from a restricted directional cell division. The shoot meristem layers gives rise to all above-ground organs in an organized pattern: the outermost layer is the L1, the cells immediately below comprise the L2, and the inner tissues define the L3. The cells and tissues derived from the respective stem cells in the three cell layers of the shoot apical meristem have the respective genotypes of these stem cells in the three cell layers of the shoot apical meristems. Although spatially separated, these layers are integrated and communicate with each other (e.g. Curr Opin Plant Biol. 2008 February; 11(1); 42-48) Tissue technology methods, wherein one or two shoot meristem layers of a variety have been replaced by another, resulting in so called periclinal chimeras, have been used in the past to study differential gene expression and trait localization in these meristem layers (e.g. Filippis et al. Using a periclinal chimera to unravel layer-specific gene expression in plants, The Plant Journal, 2013, 75: 1039-1049). Further, preliminary investigations were done to investigate the usefulness of this technology in the provision of new cultivars, for instance by making chimera of nightshade and tomato using, however, with disappointing results (Lindsay et al. Graft chimeras and somatic hybrids for new cultivars, New Zealand journal of Botany, 1995, Vol. 33: 79-92).\n\nThe inventors now for the first time made use of these tissue technology methods to successfully produce a commercially relevant crop plant comprising a new trait in a relatively short time span. The inventors have identified certain traits to be localized in the L1-shoot meristem layer. By making use of tissue technology methods, the L1-shoot meristem layer of a first plant optimized to comprise such L1-localized trait of interest and preferably having a particular genotype as defined herein, can be combined with further shoot meristem layers of a commercially relevant second plant lacking said trait, to produce a commercially relevant periclinal chimera plant having the new trait of interest. As the first plant is not required to be optimized to be commercially relevant as a whole, the number of steps required to obtain a commercially relevant plant comprising a new trait of interest is significantly reduced. In addition, the invention provides a solution for the introduction of traits that are too complex to introgress.\n\n\nSUMMARY OF THE PRESENT INVENTION\n\n\nClause 1.\n\nA method for producing a periclinal chimera plant comprising a combination of at least a first and a second L1-localized trait of interest, wherein said method comprises the steps of:\n\nNone\n",

    "description": "\n\nBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n\nField of the Invention\n\n\nThe present invention relates generally to the field of corn breeding. In particular, the invention relates to corn seed and plants of the hybrid variety designated CH011192, and derivatives and tissue cultures thereof.\n\n\nDescription of Related Art\n\n\nThe goal of field crop breeding is to combine various desirable traits in a single variety/hybrid. Such desirable traits include greater yield, better stalks, better roots, resistance to insecticides, herbicides, pests, and disease, tolerance to heat and drought, reduced time to crop maturity, better agronomic quality, higher nutritional value, and uniformity in germination times, stand establishment, growth rate, maturity, and fruit size.\n\nPlant breeding techniques take advantage of how a plant is naturally pollinated. There are two general methods of pollination. A plant is self-pollinated when pollen from one flower is transferred to the same flower or another flower of the same plant. A plant is cross-pollinated when pollen comes to it from a flower of a different plant.\n\nCorn plants (\n\nPlants that have been self-pollinated and selected for type over many generations become homozygous at almost all gene loci and produce a uniform population of true breeding progeny, i.e., a homozygous plant. A cross between two such homozygous plants produces a uniform population of hybrid plants that are heterozygous for many gene loci and phenotypically uniform.\n\nThe development of uniform corn plant hybrids requires developing homozygous inbred plants, crossing these inbred plants, and evaluating these crosses. Pedigree breeding and recurrent selection are examples of breeding methods used to develop hybrid parent plants from breeding populations. Those breeding methods combine the genetic backgrounds from two or more inbred plants or various other broad-based sources into breeding pools from which new inbred plants are developed by selfing combined with phenotypic or genotypic selection. The new inbred plants are crossed with other inbred plants and the hybrids produced by these crosses are evaluated for commercial potential.\n\nNorth American farmers plant tens of millions of acres of corn at the present time and there are extensive national and international commercial corn breeding programs. A continuing goal of these corn breeding programs is to develop corn hybrids that are based on stable inbred plants and have one or more desirable characteristics. To accomplish this goal, the corn breeder must select and develop superior inbred parental plants.\n\n\nSUMMARY OF THE INVENTION\n\n\nIn one aspect, the present invention provides a corn plant of the hybrid variety designated CH011192. Also provided are corn plants having all the physiological and morphological characteristics of the hybrid corn variety CH011192. A hybrid corn plant of the invention may further comprise a cytoplasmic or nuclear factor that is capable of conferring male sterility or otherwise preventing self-pollination, such as by self-incompatibility. Parts of the corn plant of the present invention are also provided, for example, pollen obtained from a hybrid plant and an ovule of the hybrid plant. The invention also concerns seed of the hybrid corn variety CH011192. The hybrid corn seed of the invention may be provided as a population of corn seed of the variety designated CH011192.\n\nIn a further aspect, the invention provides a composition comprising a seed of corn variety CH011192 comprised in plant seed growth media. In certain embodiments, the plant seed growth media is a soil or synthetic cultivation medium. In specific embodiments, the growth medium may be comprised in a container or may, for example, be soil in a field.\n\nIn another aspect of the invention, the hybrid corn variety CH011192 comprising an added heritable trait or genetic modification is provided. The heritable trait may comprise a genetic locus that comprises a dominant or recessive allele. In certain embodiments of the invention, the genetic locus confers traits such as, for example, male sterility, waxy starch, herbicide resistance, insect resistance, resistance to bacterial, fungal, nematode or viral disease, and altered fatty acid, phytate or carbohydrate metabolism. In certain embodiments, the genetic locus that confers herbicide resistance may confer resistance to herbicides such as, for example, imidazolinone herbicides, sulfonylurea herbicides, triazine herbicides, phenoxy herbicides, cyclohexanedione herbicides, benzonitrile herbicides, 4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate dioxygenase-inhibiting herbicides, protoporphyrinogen oxidase-inhibiting herbicides, acetolactate synthase-inhibiting herbicides, 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid synthase-inhibiting herbicides, bromoxynil, nicosulfuron, 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D), dicamba, quizalofop-p-ethyl, glyphosate, or glufosinate. The genetic locus may be a naturally occurring corn gene introduced into the genome of a parent of the variety by backcrossing, a natural or induced mutation, or a transgene introduced through genetic transformation techniques. When introduced through transformation, a genetic locus may comprise one or more transgenes integrated at a single chromosomal location.\n\nIn further embodiments, a single locus conversion of one or both of the parental varieties of the hybrid corn variety CH011192 comprises a heritable genetic modification to the genome of one or both of the parental varieties. A heritable genetic modification may comprise, for example, an insertion, deletion, or substitution of a nucleotide sequence. In certain embodiments, a single locus may comprise one or more genes or intergenic regions integrated into or mutated at a single locus or may comprise one or more nucleic acid molecules integrated at the single locus. In particular embodiments, a single locus conversion may be generated by genome editing such as through use of engineered nucleases, as is known in the art. Examples of engineered nucleases include, but are not limited to, Cas endonucleases, zinc finger nucleases (ZFNs), transcription activator-like effector nucleases (TALENs), and engineered meganucleases, also known as homing endonucleases. Naturally occurring nucleases can also find use for genome editing. In specific embodiments, endonucleases, both naturally occurring and engineered, may utilize any polypeptide-, DNA-, or RNA-guided genome editing systems known to the skilled artisan.\n\nIn yet another aspect of the invention, a hybrid corn plant of the variety designated CH011192 is provided, wherein a cytoplasmically-inherited trait has been introduced into said hybrid plant. Such cytoplasmically-inherited traits are passed to progeny through the female parent in a particular cross. An exemplary cytoplasmically-inherited trait is the male sterility trait. Cytoplasmic-male sterility (CMS) is a pollen abortion phenomenon determined by the interaction between the genes in the cytoplasm and the nucleus. Alteration in the mitochondrial genome and the lack of restorer genes in the nucleus will lead to pollen abortion. With either a normal cytoplasm or the presence of restorer gene(s) in the nucleus, the plant will produce pollen normally. A CMS plant can be pollinated by a maintainer version of the same variety, which has a normal cytoplasm but lacks the restorer gene(s) in the nucleus, and continues to be male sterile in the next generation. The male fertility of a CMS plant can be restored by a restorer version of the same variety, which must have the restorer gene(s) in the nucleus. With the restorer gene(s) in the nucleus, the offspring of the male-sterile plant can produce normal pollen grains and propagate. A cytoplasmically inherited trait may be a naturally occurring maize trait or a trait introduced through genetic transformation techniques.\n\nIn another aspect of the invention, a tissue culture of regenerable cells of a plant of variety CH011192 is provided. The tissue culture will preferably be capable of regenerating plants capable of expressing all of the physiological and morphological characteristics of the variety, and of regenerating plants having substantially the same genotype as other plants of the variety. Examples of some of the physiological and morphological characteristics of the variety CH011192 include characteristics related to yield, maturity, and kernel quality, each of which is specifically disclosed herein. The regenerable cells in such tissue cultures may, for example, be derived from embryos, meristematic cells, immature tassels, microspores, pollen, leaves, anthers, roots, root tips, silk, flowers, kernels, ears, cobs, husks, or stalks, or from callus or protoplasts derived from those tissues. Still further, the present invention provides corn plants regenerated from the tissue cultures of the invention, the plants having all the physiological and morphological characteristics of variety CH011192.\n\nIn still another aspect, the invention provides a method of producing hybrid corn seed comprising crossing a plant of variety CV457958 with a plant of variety CV430649. In a cross, either parent may serve as the male or female. Processes are also provided for producing corn seeds or plants in which the processes generally comprise crossing a first parent corn plant with a second parent corn plant, wherein at least one of the first or second parent corn plants is a plant of the variety designated CH011192. In such crossing, either parent may serve as the male or female parent. These processes may be further exemplified as processes for preparing hybrid corn seed or plants, wherein a first hybrid corn plant is crossed with a second corn plant of a different, distinct variety to provide a hybrid that has, as one of its parents, the hybrid corn plant variety CH011192. In these processes, crossing will result in the production of seed. The seed production occurs regardless of whether the seed is collected or not.\n\nIn one embodiment of the invention, the first step in âcrossingâ comprises planting, often in pollinating proximity, seeds of a first and second parent corn plant, and in many cases, seeds of a first corn plant and a second, distinct corn plant. When the plants are not in pollinating proximity, pollination can nevertheless be accomplished by transferring a pollen or tassel bag from one plant to the other as described below.\n\nA second step comprises cultivating or growing the seeds of said first and second parent corn plants into plants that bear flowers (corn bears both male flowers (tassels) and female flowers (silks) in separate anatomical structures on the same plant). A third step comprises preventing self-pollination of the plants, i.e., preventing the silks of a plant from being fertilized by any plant of the same variety, including the same plant. This can be done, for example, by emasculating the male flowers of the first or second parent corn plant, (i.e., treating or manipulating the flowers so as to prevent pollen production, in order to produce an emasculated parent corn plant). Self-incompatibility systems may also be used in some hybrid crops for the same purpose. Self-incompatible plants still shed viable pollen and can pollinate plants of other varieties but are incapable of pollinating themselves or other plants of the same variety.\n\nA fourth step may comprise allowing cross-pollination to occur between the first and second parent corn plants. When the plants are not in pollinating proximity, this is done by placing a bag, usually paper or glassine, over the tassels of the first plant and another bag over the silks of the incipient ear on the second plant. The bags are left in place for at least 24 hours. Since pollen is viable for less than 24 hours, this assures that the silks are not pollinated from other pollen sources, that any stray pollen on the tassels of the first plant is no longer viable, and that the only pollen transferred comes from the first plant. The pollen bag over the tassel of the first plant is then shaken vigorously to enhance release of pollen from the tassels, and the shoot bag is removed from the silks of the incipient ear on the second plant. Finally, the pollen bag is removed from the tassel of the first plant and is placed over the silks of the incipient ear of the second plant, shaken again and left in place. Yet another step comprises harvesting the seeds from at least one of the parent corn plants. The harvested seed can be grown to produce a corn plant or hybrid corn plant.\n\nThe present invention also provides corn seed and plants produced by a process that comprises crossing a first parent corn plant with a second parent corn plant, wherein at least one of the first or second parent corn plants is a plant of the variety designated CH011192. In one embodiment of the invention, corn seed and plants produced by the process are first generation hybrid corn seed and plants produced by crossing an inbred with another, distinct inbred. The present invention further contemplates seed of an F\n\nSuch a plant can be analyzed by its âgenetic complement.â This term is used to refer to the aggregate of nucleotide sequences, the expression of which defines the phenotype of, for example, a corn plant, or a cell or tissue of that plant. A genetic complement thus represents the genetic makeup of a cell, tissue or plant. The invention thus provides corn plant cells that have a genetic complement in accordance with the corn plant cells disclosed herein, and plants, seeds and diploid plants containing such cells.\n\nPlant genetic complements may be assessed by genetic marker profiles, and by the expression of phenotypic traits that are characteristic of the expression of the genetic complement, e.g., marker typing profiles. It is known in the art that such complements may also be identified by marker types including, but not limited to, Simple Sequence Repeats (SSRs), Simple Sequence Length Polymorphisms (SSLPs) (Williams et al., Nucleic Acids Res., 18:6531, 1990), Randomly Amplified Polymorphic DNAs (RAPDs), DNA Amplification Fingerprinting (DAF), Sequence Characterized Amplified Regions (SCARs), Arbitrary Primed Polymerase Chain Reaction (AP-PCR), Amplified Fragment Length Polymorphisms (AFLPs) (European Patent Application Publication No. EP0534858), and Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) (Wang et al., \n\nIn still yet another aspect, the present invention provides hybrid genetic complements, as represented by corn plant cells, tissues, plants, and seeds, formed by the combination of a haploid genetic complement of a corn plant of the invention with a haploid genetic complement of the same or a different variety. In another aspect, the present invention provides a corn plant regenerated from a tissue culture that comprises a hybrid genetic complement of this invention.\n",

    "description": "\n\nBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n\nField of Invention\n\n\nThis invention relates to agricultural balers, and more particularly to a device that tightens knots used to splice rolls of baling twine used on balers.\n\n\nDescription of Related Art\n\n\nIt is well known in the art to wrap compressed bales of crop materials, both âroundâ and ârectangularâ, with twine while still in the baler so as to maintain the shape and integrity of the bale after it is ejected from the baler. Twine is typically dispensed from generally cylindrical twine balls standing on end on horizontal storage shelves on the baler. The balls are usually spliced together so that when one ball is completely depleted, twine automatically starts unwrapping from the next ball without requiring operator intervention. Crop balers are provided with twine ball storage means that supports the cylindrical twine balls on their sides, with one end facing outwardly away from the baler. Among other things, having the ends of the twine balls face outwardly toward the operator makes it much easier and more convenient as he loads the storage compartment and splices the twine from one twine ball to the next twine ball.\n\nWith the desire to form bales with more densely packed crop material, it is necessary to use heavier twine and form stronger knots. The twine necessary for use in such high density balers needs to be larger than what was previously sufficient for prior art balers and is typically is stiff and slick. One problem is it is hard to tie a knot in such larger twine to spice twine balls that is small and tight. The knot needs to be small and tight enough so it can flow through the twine routing system without causing any restriction. Also it needs to be tight enough so it does not untie itself. What is needed is a mechanism that can form such small and tight knots in the twine used in high density balers.\n\n\nBRIEF SUMMARY\n\n\nIn one aspect, the invention is directed to a knot stretcher for use in tightening splice knots that connect twine balls on an agricultural baler. The knot stretcher includes a pair of pulling bars connected at pulling bar pivot at one end of each of the pulling bars, and a pair of levers, where one of the pair of levers is attached in a middle section of its respective pulling bar. Each lever has a handle portion at one end and an arm portion extending from an elbow formed in the lever. Each lever attaches to its respective pulling bar with a fixed pivot located near the elbow and distal ends of the arm portions of the two levers are attached at a moving pivot. The knot stretcher has clamping jaws positioned on the pulling bars to securely clamp a respective one of the twine tails of the splice knot that is to be tightened.\n\nThis summary is provided to introduce concepts in simplified form that are further described below in the Detailed Description.

More specifically, but not exclusively, the present disclosure relates to a hydroponic growing apparatus, system, and method.\n\n\nII. Description of the Art\n\n\nHydroponic seed growing is of increasing interest for many reasons. The increasing cost for raising seed have become, in some instances, cost prohibitive. Alternative measures for raising seed are quickly becoming of paramount concern. Scarcity of the inputs and costs of those and other inputs for growing seed also contribute to the increase in interest in hydroponically growing seed. Other concerns include labor costs, availability of laborers, consistency of grown product, shrinking availability of and increases in cost of farmland, reduction to carbon footprint, availability of food in highly populated areas, and public interest in whole-sourced foods. Still, existing hydroponic systems do not solve the present concerns and the need for a cost-effective solution for growing seed hydroponically.\n\n\nSUMMARY OF THE DISCLOSURE\n\n\nTherefore, it is an object, feature, or advantage of the present disclosure to provide a hydroponic growing apparatus, system, and method that addresses the deficiencies in existing hydroponic and non-hydroponic processes for growing seed.\n\nOften, hydroponic systems are developed and sold without the volume of seed production and return on investment being an integral factor. In other words, existing systems are not easily tailorable to fit the size of a herd.\n\nTherefore, another object, feature, or advantage of the present disclosure is to provide a hydroponic growing apparatus, system, and method that is completely tailorable to fit the specific volume of seed production desired and meets the return on investment criteria considered when weighing other hydroponic and non-hydroponic seed growing options.\n\nA significant factor in growing seed are the cost of the inputs. Water availability and cost is of increasing significance. Water and/or liquid conservation for both hydroponic and non-hydroponic seed growth is of paramount concern. Other inputs of significant, and certainly relevant consideration include the cost of seed and preservation of seed in the process of hydroponically growing seed. Still other inputs or concerns include the operational footprint or floor space needed, the electricity required, and the ability to tailor the input and output according to need and the costs, abundance/non-abundance of the relevant inputs into the process for growing seed hydroponically at comparatively low operating costs providing healthy seed growth or live green feed 365 days of the year.\n\nTherefore, another object, feature, or advantage of the present disclosure is to provide a hydroponic growing apparatus, system, and method that maximizes the return on investment for the inputs needed for hydroponically growing seed by providing a solution that addresses each concern and other factors or concerns relevant to the process of growing seed hydroponically.\n\nA still further object, feature, or advantage of the present disclosure is to provide a hydroponic growing apparatus, system, and method designed as modulated systems for meeting the variation in the needs of hydroponic seed growers while providing cost effective solutions for pre and post-handling seed, growing seed and managing other inputs used in the process.\n\nYet another object, feature, or advantage of the present disclosure is to provide a hydroponic grower for small grains or seeds such as barley and wheat that can be harvested in 3-7 days, or shorter or longer depending on the type of grain or seed being sprouted or use of the finished product.\n\nStill another object, feature, or advantage of the present disclosure is to provide a fully automated system that with the push of a harvest button the system harvests, cleans, seeds, and re-grows seed again.\n\nOne or more of these and/or other objects, features or advantages of the present disclosure will become apparent from the specification and claims that follow.\n\n\nSUMMARY OF THE DISCLOSURE\n\n\nThe present disclosure provides a hydroponic grower. The hydroponic grower is a seed growing system, apparatus, and method.\n\nThe hydroponic system can be a seed growing system that includes, for example, a framework configurable with one or more levels having a length and a width for providing one or more seed beds. A seed belt can be rotatably supported around each seed bed by at least one roller. The seed belt is configured for hydroponically growing a seed atop of the one or more seed beds. A seed belt motor and drive mechanism can be configured to be operable by the seed belt motor. The drive mechanism is operably attached for rotating the seed belt. A seeder is rotatably attached atop the seed bed and the seeder can be configured with an intake connected to a seed source \n\nThe hydroponic system can be a seed growing apparatus that includes, for example, a hydroponic seed grower for hydroponically growing a variety of seed. The hydroponic seed grower can include a plurality of seed beds operably supported by a framework, where each seed bed disposed across a length and a width of the framework. A seed belt is operable on each of the plurality of seed beds between loading and offloading positions to and from a seed growing position. A seed belt motor can be operably attached to the seed belt for rotating the seed belt between loading and offloading positions to and from the seed growing position. A liquid nozzle can be operably attached adjacent the seed belt for cutting offloaded seed growth along a first direction. The liquid nozzle can be configured having a discharge for discharging a liquid for cutting through offloaded seed growth and an inlet operably connected to a pressurized liquid source.\n\nThe hydroponic system can be a method for hydroponically growing seed, such as for example, a method for hydroponically growing a variety of seed. The method can include providing one or more seed beds each having a length and a width operably supported by a framework. Steps can include, for example, rotating a seed belt around each of the one or more seed beds between loading and offloading positions to and from a seed growing position, discharging a seed onto the seed belt for hydroponically growing a seed atop of the one or more seed beds, and offloading seed growth through the path of a stream of liquid exiting a liquid nozzle for cutting through offloaded seed growth in a first direction.\n",

    "abstract": "Systems and methods herein improve plant growth through a combination of monochromatic laser light and Emerson effect enhancement. A microcontroller can change the frequency of a laser module and an LED array to enhance growth. For example, 663 nm can be used as an energy pump, and a phytochrome effect can be applied at 730 nm during flowering to extend the amount of time a flowering plant can handle light. A racking system can accept slidable LED lights for easy positioning. Additionally, a controller can use one or more scalar wave guides for channeling scalar energy. These can be active or passive. In one example, a controller causes the scalar wave guide to create an electromagnetic cancelation field whereby the device harnesses the fundamental earth Shuman resonance of 7.83 Hz and amplifies it to create anions in a predominantly cation rich environment.\n\n",
    "description": "\n\nBACKGROUND\n\n\nPeople have been growing plants for a variety of purposes for thousands of years. Many techniques have been employed to enhance growth rates, flowering, and crop production. This has included regulation of nutrients provided to the plants, CO\n\nTypical grow light fixtures use high intensity discharge (HID) lamps, which can be costly to manufacture and operate. For example, many HID grow lamps cost thousands of dollars, may consume on the order of 400-1000 watts of electricity, and often produce excessive amounts of heat and noise.\n\nU.S. Pat. No. 6,921,182 to Anderson, Jr., et al. discloses an LED lamp for enhancing commercial and home plant growth, including a first set of orange LEDs with a peak wavelength emission of about 612 nanometers, a second set of red-light emitting LEDs with a peak wavelength of about 660 nanometers, and blue light LEDs. Two beam spreads, 15 degrees and 30 degrees, were provided for both the 660 nm LEDs and 612 nm LEDs. When directed perpendicularly upon tops of the plant leaves, 10% light transmission occurred through the leaves for the 30-degree LEDs, and 80% light transmission for the 15-degree LEDs. Thus, Anderson reports that fully 50% of the orange/red spectrum primarily used for photosynthesis was transmitted through the upper leaf canopy, making it available to support photosynthesis in leaves below. Anderson describes positioning LED lamps at varying distances from the growing plants for controlling plant growth rates that vary with these distances, thereby to control plant inventory, because growth of plants can be greatly slowed to preserve them during periods of slow sales.\n\nU.S. Patent Application 20040264195 by Chang et al. describes a light emitting diode (LED) light source including a printed circuit board, a heat sink, a plurality of heat conductors, and at least one LED chip. The printed circuit board (PCB) has a plurality of holes. The heat sink connects under the PCB for conducting heat. Each heat conductor is formed on the heat sink corresponding to each hole of the PCB for conducting heat, and each heat conductor has a basin on the topside. The LED chip is attached to the basin of the heat conductor.\n\nU.S. Patent Application 20060006820 by Roseman, et al. teaches a horticultural lighting system comprising a light source that emits specific and specialized light spectra and is adjustable through the use of a control interface, which is able to support plants from seedling to mature flowering and fruiting adults. The lighting system utilizes a power source to energize a lighting fixture. A given lighting fixture includes high efficiency luminary devices that may have varying color combinations and spatial arrangements. A substrate provides support and thermal management. Electrical connectors allow multiple lighting fixtures to be connected to a single power source. A switching device allows linear control of intensity, time and color parameters of the emitted light, and is programmable to simulate photoperiods and spectrum shift. Roseman describes the system as being optimized to stimulate growth in plants during times of different light-intensity and light-spectrum needs. The Roseman design takes into consideration various factors so the claimed lighting system is described as operating at the highest possible efficiency and exhibiting the longest possible life.\n\nU.S. Patent Application 20060254135 by Dubuc discloses a method and apparatus for irradiation of plants using light emitting diodes. The method uses LEDs to supplement natural light in a greenhouse and a support structure for attaching LEDs in a greenhouse so that the plants receive substantially even light distribution from the LEDs and minimal natural light is blocked by the lighting system. A narrow attachment rail is used to suspend a strip of LEDs from the frame structure of the greenhouse.\n\nU.S. Patent Application 20070058368 by Partee et al. describes a high brightness LED system that generates radiometric light energy capable of controlling growth of plants from seed to full maturity. According to one or more aspects of that invention, a unit is disclosed that provides artificial light to promote plant growth. The unit utilizes red and blue light emitting diodes (LEDs) to emit wavelengths of light that are more favorable to plant growth. In particular, blue LEDs are interspersed with red LED's to broadcast a desired range of light. Although the LEDs operate at lower temperatures than conventional artificial light sources and thus allow the unit to be placed closer to plants for more efficient growth, the unit includes a heat sink to disperse even more heat. Separate switches are included to control the red and blue LEDs to allow controlled exposure to different light sources to facilitate desired plant growth.\n\nU.S Patent Application 20070268693 by Crabb, et al. teaches a method and apparatus of lighting a marine habitat for growth utilizing an LED light system. The light system includes an LED light source, a power supply for such light source and a controller for controlling the activation status and the intensity of the LED light source.\n\nThe foregoing patents and patent applications reflect the current state of the art. Reference to, and discussion of, these patents and patent applications is intended to aid in discharging Applicant's acknowledged duty of candor in disclosing information that may be relevant to the examination of claims to the present invention. However, it is respectfully submitted that none of the above-indicated patents and patent applications disclose, teach, suggest, show, or otherwise render obvious, either singly or when considered in combination, the invention described and claimed herein.\n\nOne objective of the horticultural industry is to grow plants as naturally as possible while minimizing waste in a controlled environment where growth rates and increased yields could surpass the natural environment. However, this has proven to be impossible to achieve as many aspects of the way nature nurtures life on this planet is still beyond our understanding or is so complex in its simplistic way of achieving it. As many disciplines across numerus scientific fields are required to fathom its complexity, it is noticed in the industry by botanist, microbiologist and growers that something is missing, and it becomes a constant battle to get the correct recipe for success, one that works according to the scientific way for all plant types.\n\nPlants do have a nervous system based on action potentials transmitted along phloem conduits but which in addition, through anastomoses and other cross-links, forms a complex network. The emergent potential for this excitable network to form a mental state is unknown, but it might be used to distinguish between different and even contradictory signals to the individual plant and thus determine a priority of response. This plant nervous system stretches throughout the whole plant providing the potential for assessment in all parts and commensurate with its self-organizing, phenotypically plastic behavior. Plasticity may, in turn, depend heavily on the instructive capabilities of local bioelectric fields enabling both a degree of behavioral independence but influenced by the condition of the whole plant.\n\nPlants use photosynthesis to convert water and carbon dioxide to create organic compounds such as cellulose or glucose. It is well-established that artificial lights can be a substitute for natural sunlight. In addition to conventional incandescent lights, High Intensity Discharge (HID) lamps, such as Metal Halide (MH) and High-Pressure Sodium (HPS), have been used to grow plants. Fluorescent lamps are another example of artificial illumination used to grow plants. Some plant growers desire the ability to control the amount of light provided to the plant.\n\nHID and fluorescent lamps require an electronic ballast for operation, which makes controlling the light intensity a challenge. Light emitting diodes (LEDs) are new a lighting technology in the grow light industry. LEDs emit light at specific wavelength bands depending upon the type of diode. Because of this narrow wavelength band, a white LED is actually comprised of a mix of different color LEDs to create the white light. The intensity of an LED may be controlled as well. Therefore, LEDs may be dimmed.\n\nLike any other industry, the agricultural industry seeks to increase production and lower operating costs of its products. Generally, plants exposed to more red light tend to grow stouter and with broader leaves. Plants exposed to more blue light tend to grow faster and taller but with thinner stems and smaller leaves.\n\nResearch has determined that the 660 nm wavelength is crucial to trigger flowering in a plant. In some plant species the 660 nm wavelength must not be present longer than 12 hours per day in order for the plant to flower and to continue to flower. The solution has been to provide illumination for less than 12 hours per day and time manage the light source. This, in turn, limits or decreases yield.\n\nFor at least these reasons, a need exists for systems for enhanced plant growth using lasers.\n\n\nSUMMARY\n\n\nSystems and methods disclosed herein can utilize lights, magnetic fields, earthing, resonance and ionic scalar waves for optimizing the growth of plants. In it is desirable for those in the industry to have a grow enhancement and lighting system that is capable of increased yield and increased grow rate. The systems and methods described herein can have advantages over conventional and currently available systems in the market. The system can combine numerous fields of discipline in a novel way to increase growth rates with increased yields with as little as possible waste, using computer-implemented methods to mimic aspects of the natural environment.\n\nIn one example, the system can include a lighting array that includes at least a laser and an LED light. The laser can emit monochromatic light having a frequency wavelength within a range of 600 nanometers (ânmâ) to 700 nm. For example, the laser can have a wavelength of 660 nm. The laser can be a solid-state laser diode.\n\nA scalar energy source can be positioned within six inches of a plant. This can include positioning a scalar wave guide that provides scalar energy at the base of the plant. Another scalar wave guide can also condition water that is provided to the plant. The scalar wave guide can have an array of magnets, the array including first and second magnets organized such that opposing poles of the first and second magnets are adjacent to one another, wherein the controller selectively powers the array of magnets.\n\nIn one example, a controller monitors a resonance frequency that is provided by a feedback loop. The feedback loop is created using a grounding pin and passing current into the ground. Based on the monitoring, the controller can amplify a Schuman frequency for the resonance frequency. To do this, the controller can use the scalar wave guide in an example. The scalar wave guide can produce an electromagnetic cancelation field at a Shuman resonance frequency and amplify the electromagnetic cancellation field.\n\nThe controller can also adjust a wavelength of an LED within a spectrum of 660 nm to 700 nm to cause cell elongation and increase osmosis. The controller can also apply a phytochrome effect by switching the wavelength of the LED to a range of 710 nm to 750 nm. The phytochrome effect can be automatically applied for between two and six minutes during a flowering phase of the plant.\n\nThis can result in an improved growth for plants. In one embodiment of this invention a modular system comprising of solid-state LEDs and solid-state laser modules equipped with special diffraction lenses and phosphoresce coating. Incorporating a management arrangement with remote wireless interface. BLUETOOTH and Wi-Fi enabled for full online and off-line control and interface. User-friendly mobile app and grow optimization software as part of the management arrangement. Encapsulated in a sealed heat dissipation system, with enhanced efficiency and thermal management.\n\nIn one example, the system can utilize UV light at a wavelength specific to creation of UV light radiation and ozone. This UV light can act as an oxidant and photo oxidant to prevent disease and to trigger increased production of Tetrahydrocannabinol (âTHCâ) in the case of marijuana plant species. However, the UV light can also increase growth production of other types of plants.\n\nThe scalar field can be generated by a series of magnets and counteract the negative effects of, amongst other things, electromagnetic smog. A further aspect of this invention incorporates a novel magnetic field arrangement with microprocessor control for growth enhancement. Yet a further aspect of this invention utilizes an Earthing system with management arrangement. A further embodiment of this invention is a novel way to induce and maintain of Schuman resonance frequency in the grow environment. Yet another aspect of this invention is a novel electromagnet with frequency enhancement acting as a magnetohydrodynamic system to treat irrigation water.\n",

    "description": "\n\nBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n\nField of the Invention\n\n\nThe present invention relates generally to the field of corn breeding. In particular, the invention relates to corn seed and plants of the hybrid variety designated CH011006, and derivatives and tissue cultures thereof.\n\n\nDescription of Related Art\n\n\nThe goal of field crop breeding is to combine various desirable traits in a single variety/hybrid. Such desirable traits include greater yield, better stalks, better roots, resistance to insecticides, herbicides, pests, and disease, tolerance to heat and drought, reduced time to crop maturity, better agronomic quality, higher nutritional value, and uniformity in germination times, stand establishment, growth rate, maturity, and fruit size.\n\nPlant breeding techniques take advantage of how a plant is naturally pollinated. There are two general methods of pollination. A plant is self-pollinated when pollen from one flower is transferred to the same flower or another flower of the same plant. A plant is cross-pollinated when pollen comes to it from a flower of a different plant.\n\nCorn plants (\n\nPlants that have been self-pollinated and selected for type over many generations become homozygous at almost all gene loci and produce a uniform population of true breeding progeny, i.e., a homozygous plant. A cross between two such homozygous plants produces a uniform population of hybrid plants that are heterozygous for many gene loci and phenotypically uniform.\n\nThe development of uniform corn plant hybrids requires developing homozygous inbred plants, crossing these inbred plants, and evaluating these crosses. Pedigree breeding and recurrent selection are examples of breeding methods used to develop hybrid parent plants from breeding populations. Those breeding methods combine the genetic backgrounds from two or more inbred plants or various other broad-based sources into breeding pools from which new inbred plants are developed by selfing combined with phenotypic or genotypic selection. The new inbred plants are crossed with other inbred plants and the hybrids produced by these crosses are evaluated for commercial potential.\n\nNorth American farmers plant tens of millions of acres of corn at the present time and there are extensive national and international commercial corn breeding programs. A continuing goal of these corn breeding programs is to develop corn hybrids that are based on stable inbred plants and have one or more desirable characteristics. To accomplish this goal, the corn breeder must select and develop superior inbred parental plants.\n\n\nSUMMARY OF THE INVENTION\n\n\nIn one aspect, the present invention provides a corn plant of the hybrid variety designated CH011006. Also provided are corn plants having all the physiological and morphological characteristics of the hybrid corn variety CH011006. A hybrid corn plant of the invention may further comprise a cytoplasmic or nuclear factor that is capable of conferring male sterility or otherwise preventing self-pollination, such as by self-incompatibility. Parts of the corn plant of the present invention are also provided, for example, pollen obtained from a hybrid plant and an ovule of the hybrid plant. The invention also concerns seed of the hybrid corn variety CH011006. The hybrid corn seed of the invention may be provided as a population of corn seed of the variety designated CH011006.\n\nIn a further aspect, the invention provides a composition comprising a seed of corn variety CH011006 comprised in plant seed growth media. In certain embodiments, the plant seed growth media is a soil or synthetic cultivation medium. In specific embodiments, the growth medium may be comprised in a container or may, for example, be soil in a field.\n\nIn another aspect of the invention, the hybrid corn variety CH011006 comprising an added heritable trait or genetic modification is provided. The heritable trait may comprise a genetic locus that comprises a dominant or recessive allele. In certain embodiments of the invention, the genetic locus confers traits such as, for example, male sterility, waxy starch, herbicide resistance, insect resistance, resistance to bacterial, fungal, nematode or viral disease, and altered fatty acid, phytate or carbohydrate metabolism. In certain embodiments, the genetic locus that confers herbicide resistance may confer resistance to herbicides such as, for example, imidazolinone herbicides, sulfonylurea herbicides, triazine herbicides, phenoxy herbicides, cyclohexanedione herbicides, benzonitrile herbicides, 4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate dioxygenase-inhibiting herbicides, protoporphyrinogen oxidase-inhibiting herbicides, acetolactate synthase-inhibiting herbicides, 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid synthase-inhibiting herbicides, bromoxynil, nicosulfuron, 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D), dicamba, quizalofop-p-ethyl, glyphosate, or glufosinate. The genetic locus may be a naturally occurring corn gene introduced into the genome of a parent of the variety by backcrossing, a natural or induced mutation, or a transgene introduced through genetic transformation techniques. When introduced through transformation, a genetic locus may comprise one or more transgenes integrated at a single chromosomal location.\n\nIn further embodiments, a single locus conversion of one or both of the parental varieties of the hybrid corn variety CH011006 comprises a heritable genetic modification to the genome of one or both of the parental varieties. A heritable genetic modification may comprise, for example, an insertion, deletion, or substitution of a nucleotide sequence. In certain embodiments, a single locus may comprise one or more genes or intergenic regions integrated into or mutated at a single locus or may comprise one or more nucleic acid molecules integrated at the single locus. In particular embodiments, a single locus conversion may be generated by genome editing such as through use of engineered nucleases, as is known in the art. Examples of engineered nucleases include, but are not limited to, Cas endonucleases, zinc finger nucleases (ZFNs), transcription activator-like effector nucleases (TALENs), and engineered meganucleases, also known as homing endonucleases. Naturally occurring nucleases can also find use for genome editing. In specific embodiments, endonucleases, both naturally occurring and engineered, may utilize any polypeptide-, DNA-, or RNA-guided genome editing systems known to the skilled artisan.\n\nIn yet another aspect of the invention, a hybrid corn plant of the variety designated CH011006 is provided, wherein a cytoplasmically-inherited trait has been introduced into said hybrid plant. Such cytoplasmically-inherited traits are passed to progeny through the female parent in a particular cross. An exemplary cytoplasmically-inherited trait is the male sterility trait. Cytoplasmic-male sterility (CMS) is a pollen abortion phenomenon determined by the interaction between the genes in the cytoplasm and the nucleus. Alteration in the mitochondrial genome and the lack of restorer genes in the nucleus will lead to pollen abortion. With either a normal cytoplasm or the presence of restorer gene(s) in the nucleus, the plant will produce pollen normally. A CMS plant can be pollinated by a maintainer version of the same variety, which has a normal cytoplasm but lacks the restorer gene(s) in the nucleus, and continues to be male sterile in the next generation. The male fertility of a CMS plant can be restored by a restorer version of the same variety, which must have the restorer gene(s) in the nucleus. With the restorer gene(s) in the nucleus, the offspring of the male-sterile plant can produce normal pollen grains and propagate. A cytoplasmically inherited trait may be a naturally occurring maize trait or a trait introduced through genetic transformation techniques.\n\nIn another aspect of the invention, a tissue culture of regenerable cells of a plant of variety CH011006 is provided. The tissue culture will preferably be capable of regenerating plants capable of expressing all of the physiological and morphological characteristics of the variety, and of regenerating plants having substantially the same genotype as other plants of the variety. Examples of some of the physiological and morphological characteristics of the variety CH011006 include characteristics related to yield, maturity, and kernel quality, each of which is specifically disclosed herein. The regenerable cells in such tissue cultures may, for example, be derived from embryos, meristematic cells, immature tassels, microspores, pollen, leaves, anthers, roots, root tips, silk, flowers, kernels, ears, cobs, husks, or stalks, or from callus or protoplasts derived from those tissues. Still further, the present invention provides corn plants regenerated from the tissue cultures of the invention, the plants having all the physiological and morphological characteristics of variety CH011006.\n\nIn still another aspect, the invention provides a method of producing hybrid corn seed comprising crossing a plant of variety CV181138 with a plant of variety CV422086. In a cross, either parent may serve as the male or female. Processes are also provided for producing corn seeds or plants in which the processes generally comprise crossing a first parent corn plant with a second parent corn plant, wherein at least one of the first or second parent corn plants is a plant of the variety designated CH011006. In such crossing, either parent may serve as the male or female parent. These processes may be further exemplified as processes for preparing hybrid corn seed or plants, wherein a first hybrid corn plant is crossed with a second corn plant of a different, distinct variety to provide a hybrid that has, as one of its parents, the hybrid corn plant variety CH011006. In these processes, crossing will result in the production of seed. The seed production occurs regardless of whether the seed is collected or not.\n\nIn one embodiment of the invention, the first step in âcrossingâ comprises planting, often in pollinating proximity, seeds of a first and second parent corn plant, and in many cases, seeds of a first corn plant and a second, distinct corn plant. When the plants are not in pollinating proximity, pollination can nevertheless be accomplished by transferring a pollen or tassel bag from one plant to the other as described below.\n\nA second step comprises cultivating or growing the seeds of said first and second parent corn plants into plants that bear flowers (corn bears both male flowers (tassels) and female flowers (silks) in separate anatomical structures on the same plant). A third step comprises preventing self-pollination of the plants, i.e., preventing the silks of a plant from being fertilized by any plant of the same variety, including the same plant. This can be done, for example, by emasculating the male flowers of the first or second parent corn plant, (i.e., treating or manipulating the flowers so as to prevent pollen production, in order to produce an emasculated parent corn plant). Self-incompatibility systems may also be used in some hybrid crops for the same purpose. Self-incompatible plants still shed viable pollen and can pollinate plants of other varieties but are incapable of pollinating themselves or other plants of the same variety.\n\nA fourth step may comprise allowing cross-pollination to occur between the first and second parent corn plants. When the plants are not in pollinating proximity, this is done by placing a bag, usually paper or glassine, over the tassels of the first plant and another bag over the silks of the incipient ear on the second plant. The bags are left in place for at least 24 hours. Since pollen is viable for less than 24 hours, this assures that the silks are not pollinated from other pollen sources, that any stray pollen on the tassels of the first plant is no longer viable, and that the only pollen transferred comes from the first plant. The pollen bag over the tassel of the first plant is then shaken vigorously to enhance release of pollen from the tassels, and the shoot bag is removed from the silks of the incipient ear on the second plant. Finally, the pollen bag is removed from the tassel of the first plant and is placed over the silks of the incipient ear of the second plant, shaken again and left in place. Yet another step comprises harvesting the seeds from at least one of the parent corn plants. The harvested seed can be grown to produce a corn plant or hybrid corn plant.\n\nThe present invention also provides corn seed and plants produced by a process that comprises crossing a first parent corn plant with a second parent corn plant, wherein at least one of the first or second parent corn plants is a plant of the variety designated CH011006. In one embodiment of the invention, corn seed and plants produced by the process are first generation hybrid corn seed and plants produced by crossing an inbred with another, distinct inbred. The present invention further contemplates seed of an F\n\nSuch a plant can be analyzed by its âgenetic complement.â This term is used to refer to the aggregate of nucleotide sequences, the expression of which defines the phenotype of, for example, a corn plant, or a cell or tissue of that plant. A genetic complement thus represents the genetic makeup of a cell, tissue or plant. The invention thus provides corn plant cells that have a genetic complement in accordance with the corn plant cells disclosed herein, and plants, seeds and diploid plants containing such cells.\n\nPlant genetic complements may be assessed by genetic marker profiles, and by the expression of phenotypic traits that are characteristic of the expression of the genetic complement, e.g., marker typing profiles. It is known in the art that such complements may also be identified by marker types including, but not limited to, Simple Sequence Repeats (SSRs), Simple Sequence Length Polymorphisms (SSLPs) (Williams et al., \n\nIn still yet another aspect, the present invention provides hybrid genetic complements, as represented by corn plant cells, tissues, plants, and seeds, formed by the combination of a haploid genetic complement of a corn plant of the invention with a haploid genetic complement of the same or a different variety. In another aspect, the present invention provides a corn plant regenerated from a tissue culture that comprises a hybrid genetic complement of this invention.\n",

    "description": "\n\nBACKGROUND\n\n\n\nField\n\n\nEmbodiments of the present disclosure generally relate to indoor agriculture systems. More specifically, embodiments of the present disclosure relate to metrology systems for grow tower weight measurement.\n\n\nDescription of the Related Art\n\n\nConventional agricultural practices have evolved rapidly over the twentieth century to what can now be considered a fast-moving high-tech industry. Global food shortages, climate change, a societal changes instigated a transition from manually implemented agriculture techniques toward advanced farming methods, such as mechanized and automated farming. While conventional agricultural practices often limit a farmer to one growing season, indoor farming can eliminate environmental constraints and increase crop production. Controlled environment agriculture, or indoor farming, often implements data processing technologies and many advances, such as crop yield and the like, can be gained by utilizing such technologies.\n\nHowever, commercial scale controlled environment agriculture is still in its relative infancy when compared to conventional agricultural practices. Although there exists great potential for data collection and analysis of various aspects of controlled environment agriculture, such technologies are not well developed. For example, the ability to efficiently and accurately measure crop yields remains difficult even within controlled environment agriculture systems.\n\nAccordingly, what is needed in the art are improved metrology apparatus and processes for controlled environment agriculture systems.\n\n\nSUMMARY\n\n\nIn one embodiment, a hook for a grow tower apparatus is provided. The apparatus includes a first hook portion having a groove engaging member extending from the first hook portion, a second hook portion having a flange extending from the second hook portion, and a load cell coupled between the first hook portion and the second hook portion. The load cell includes a first arm coupled to the first hook portion by a first bracket and a second arm coupled to the second hook portion by a second bracket.\n\nIn another embodiment, a hook for a grow tower apparatus is provided. The apparatus includes a body having a flange extending therefrom, a first extension of the body extending opposite the flange, a second extension of the body extending laterally from the first extension of the body, a top extending in a direction substantially normal to the second extension of the body, a load cell coupled to the tip, and a groove engaging member coupled to the load cell.\n\nIn another embodiment, a grow line apparatus is provided. The apparatus includes a body having a first arm extending along a centerline of the body, a second arm of the body extending opposite the first arm, a base member extending laterally from the second arm and across the centerline of the body, and a lip extending from the base member toward the first arm. The lip, the base member, and the second arm define a groove and a load cell is disposed in the groove.\n",

Methods for producing a maize plant by crossing hybrid maize variety X03R591 with another maize plant are disclosed. Methods for producing a maize plant containing in its genetic material one or more traits introgressed into X03R591 through backcrossing or genetic transformation, and to the maize seed, plant and plant part produced thereby are described. Maize variety X03R591, the seed, the plant produced from the seed, and variants, mutants, and minor modifications of maize variety X03R591 are provided. Methods for producing maize varieties derived from maize variety X03R591 and methods of using maize variety X03R591 are disclosed.\n\n",
    "description": "\n\nBACKGROUND\n\n\nThe goal of hybrid development is to combine, in a single hybrid, various desirable traits. For field crops, these traits may include resistance to diseases and insects, resistance to heat and drought, reducing the time to crop maturity, greater yield, and better agronomic quality. With mechanical harvesting of many crops, uniformity of plant characteristics such as germination, stand establishment, growth rate, maturity, and plant and ear height is important. Traditional plant breeding is an important tool in developing new and improved commercial crops.\n\n\nSUMMARY\n\n\nProvided is a novel maize, \n\nThe hybrid maize plant may further comprise a cytoplasmic or nuclear factor capable of conferring male sterility or otherwise preventing self-pollination, such as by self-incompatibility. Parts of the maize plants disclosed herein are also provided, for example, pollen obtained from a hybrid plant and an ovule of the hybrid plant. Seed of the hybrid maize variety X03R591 is provided and may be provided as a population of maize seed of the variety designated X03R591.\n\nCompositions are provided comprising a seed of maize variety X03R591 comprised in plant seed growth media. In certain embodiments, the plant seed growth media is a soil or synthetic cultivation medium. In specific embodiments, the growth medium may be comprised in a container or may, for example, be soil in a field.\n\nHybrid maize variety X03R591 is provided comprising an added heritable trait. The heritable trait may be a genetic locus that is a dominant or recessive allele. In certain embodiments, the genetic locus confers traits such as, for example, male sterility, waxy starch, reduced lignin, herbicide tolerance or resistance, insect resistance, resistance to bacterial, fungal, nematode or viral disease, and altered or modified fatty acid, phytate, protein or carbohydrate metabolism. The genetic locus may be a naturally occurring maize gene introduced into the genome of a parent of the variety by backcrossing, a natural or induced mutation, or a transgene introduced through genetic transformation techniques. When introduced through transformation, a genetic locus may comprise one or more transgenes integrated at a single chromosomal location.\n\nA hybrid maize plant of the variety designated X03R591 is provided, wherein a cytoplasmically-inherited trait has been introduced into the hybrid plant. Such cytoplasmically-inherited traits are passed to progeny through the female parent in a particular cross. An exemplary cytoplasmically-inherited trait is the male sterility trait. Cytoplasmic-male sterility (CMS) is a pollen abortion phenomenon determined by the interaction between the genes in the cytoplasm and the nucleus. Alteration in the mitochondrial genome and the lack of restorer genes in the nucleus will lead to pollen abortion. With either a normal cytoplasm or the presence of restorer gene(s) in the nucleus, the plant will produce pollen normally. A CMS plant can be pollinated by a maintainer version of the same variety, which has a normal cytoplasm but lacks the restorer gene(s) in the nucleus, and continues to be male sterile in the next generation. The male fertility of a CMS plant can be restored by a restorer version of the same variety, which must have the restorer gene(s) in the nucleus. With the restorer gene(s) in the nucleus, the offspring of the male-sterile plant can produce normal pollen grains and propagate. A cytoplasmically inherited trait may be a naturally occurring maize trait or a trait introduced through genetic transformation techniques.\n\nA tissue culture of regenerable cells of a plant of variety X03R591 is provided. The tissue culture can be capable of regenerating plants capable of expressing all of the physiological and morphological or phenotypic characteristics of the variety and of regenerating plants having substantially the same genotype as other plants of the variety. Examples of some of the physiological and morphological characteristics of the variety X03R591 that may be assessed include characteristics related to yield, maturity, and kernel quality. The regenerable cells in such tissue cultures can be derived, for example, from embryos, meristematic cells, immature tassels, microspores, pollen, leaves, anthers, roots, root tips, silk, flowers, kernels, ears, cobs, husks, or stalks, or from callus or protoplasts derived from those tissues. Maize plants regenerated from the tissue cultures and plants having all or essentially all of the physiological and morphological characteristics of variety X03R591 are also provided.\n\nA method of producing hybrid maize seed comprising crossing a plant of variety PH4DFV with a plant of variety PH17RM. In a cross, either parent may serve as the male or female. Processes are also provided for producing maize seeds or plants, which processes generally comprise crossing a first parent maize plant as a male or female parent with a second parent maize plant, wherein at least one of the first or second parent maize plants is a plant of the variety designated X03R591. In such crossing, either parent may serve as the male or female parent. These processes may be further exemplified as processes for preparing hybrid maize seed or plants, wherein a first hybrid maize plant is crossed with a second maize plant of a different, distinct variety to provide a hybrid that has, as one of its parents, the hybrid maize plant variety X03R591. In these processes, crossing will result in the production of seed. The seed production occurs regardless of whether the seed is collected or not.\n\nIn some embodiments, the first step in âcrossingâ comprises planting, often in pollinating proximity, seeds of a first and second parent maize plant, and in many cases, seeds of a first maize plant and a second, distinct maize plant. Where the plants are not in pollinating proximity, pollination can nevertheless be accomplished by other means, such as by transferring a pollen or tassel bag from one plant to the other.\n\nA second step comprises cultivating or growing the seeds of said first and second parent maize plants into plants that bear flowers (maize bears both male flowers (tassels) and female flowers (silks) in separate anatomical structures on the same plant).\n\nA third step comprises preventing self-pollination of the plants, i.e., preventing the silks of a plant from being fertilized by any plant of the same variety, including the same plant. This can be done, for example, by emasculating the male flowers of the first or second parent maize plant, (i.e., treating or manipulating the flowers so as to prevent pollen production, in order to produce an emasculated parent maize plant). Self-incompatibility systems may also be used in some hybrid crops for the same purpose. Self-incompatible plants still shed viable pollen and can pollinate plants of other varieties but are incapable of pollinating themselves or other plants of the same variety.\n\nA fourth step may comprise allowing cross-pollination to occur between the first and second parent maize plants. When the plants are not in pollinating proximity, this can be done by placing a bag, usually paper or glassine, over the tassels of the first plant and another bag over the silks of the incipient ear on the second plant. The bags are left in place for at least 24 hours. Since pollen is viable for less than 24 hours, this assures that the silks are not pollinated from other pollen sources, that any stray pollen on the tassels of the first plant is dead, and that the only pollen transferred comes from the first plant. The pollen bag over the tassel of the first plant is then shaken vigorously to enhance release of pollen from the tassels, and the shoot bag is removed from the silks of the incipient ear on the second plant. Finally, the pollen bag is removed from the tassel of the first plant and is placed over the silks of the incipient ear of the second plant, shaken again and left in place. Yet another step comprises harvesting the seeds from at least one of the parent maize plants. The harvested seed can be grown to produce a maize plant or hybrid maize plant.\n\nMaize seed and plants are provided that are produced by a process that comprises crossing a first parent maize plant with a second parent maize plant, wherein at least one of the first or second parent maize plants is a plant of the variety designated X03R591. Maize seed and plants produced by the process are first generation hybrid maize seed and plants produced by crossing an inbred with another, distinct inbred. Seed of an F1 hybrid maize plant, an F1 hybrid maize plant and seed thereof, specifically the hybrid variety designated X03R591 is provided.\n\nPlants described herein can be analyzed by their âgenetic complement.â This term is used to refer to the aggregate of nucleotide sequences, the expression of which defines the phenotype of, for example, a maize plant, or a cell or tissue of that plant. A genetic complement thus represents the genetic makeup of a cell, tissue or plant. Provided are maize plant cells that have a genetic complement in accordance with the maize plant cells disclosed herein, and plants, seeds and diploid plants containing such cells.\n\nPlant genetic complements may be assessed by genetic marker profiles, and by the expression of phenotypic traits that are characteristic of the expression of the genetic complement, e.g., isozyme typing profiles. It is understood that variety X03R591 could be identified by any of the many well-known techniques used for genetic profiling disclosed herein.\n",

    "description": "\n\nBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n\nField of the Invention\n\n\nThe present invention relates generally to the field of corn breeding. In particular, the invention relates to corn seed and plants of the hybrid variety designated CH011199, and derivatives and tissue cultures thereof.\n\n\nDescription of Related Art\n\n\nThe goal of field crop breeding is to combine various desirable traits in a single variety/hybrid. Such desirable traits include greater yield, better stalks, better roots, resistance to insecticides, herbicides, pests, and disease, tolerance to heat and drought, reduced time to crop maturity, better agronomic quality, higher nutritional value, and uniformity in germination times, stand establishment, growth rate, maturity, and fruit size.\n\nPlant breeding techniques take advantage of how a plant is naturally pollinated. There are two general methods of pollination. A plant is self-pollinated when pollen from one flower is transferred to the same flower or another flower of the same plant. A plant is cross-pollinated when pollen comes to it from a flower of a different plant.\n\nCorn plants (\n\nPlants that have been self-pollinated and selected for type over many generations become homozygous at almost all gene loci and produce a uniform population of true breeding progeny, i.e., a homozygous plant. A cross between two such homozygous plants produces a uniform population of hybrid plants that are heterozygous for many gene loci and phenotypically uniform.\n\nThe development of uniform corn plant hybrids requires developing homozygous inbred plants, crossing these inbred plants, and evaluating these crosses. Pedigree breeding and recurrent selection are examples of breeding methods used to develop hybrid parent plants from breeding populations. Those breeding methods combine the genetic backgrounds from two or more inbred plants or various other broad-based sources into breeding pools from which new inbred plants are developed by selfing combined with phenotypic or genotypic selection. The new inbred plants are crossed with other inbred plants and the hybrids produced by these crosses are evaluated for commercial potential.\n\nNorth American farmers plant tens of millions of acres of corn at the present time and there are extensive national and international commercial corn breeding programs. A continuing goal of these corn breeding programs is to develop corn hybrids that are based on stable inbred plants and have one or more desirable characteristics. To accomplish this goal, the corn breeder must select and develop superior inbred parental plants.\n\n\nSUMMARY OF THE INVENTION\n\n\nIn one aspect, the present invention provides a corn plant of the hybrid variety designated CH011199. Also provided are corn plants having all the physiological and morphological characteristics of the hybrid corn variety CH011199. A hybrid corn plant of the invention may further comprise a cytoplasmic or nuclear factor that is capable of conferring male sterility or otherwise preventing self-pollination, such as by self-incompatibility. Parts of the corn plant of the present invention are also provided, for example, pollen obtained from a hybrid plant and an ovule of the hybrid plant. The invention also concerns seed of the hybrid corn variety CH011199. The hybrid corn seed of the invention may be provided as a population of corn seed of the variety designated CH011199.\n\nIn a further aspect, the invention provides a composition comprising a seed of corn variety CH011199 comprised in plant seed growth media. In certain embodiments, the plant seed growth media is a soil or synthetic cultivation medium. In specific embodiments, the growth medium may be comprised in a container or may, for example, be soil in a field.\n\nIn another aspect of the invention, the hybrid corn variety CH011199 comprising an added heritable trait or genetic modification is provided. The heritable trait may comprise a genetic locus that comprises a dominant or recessive allele. In certain embodiments of the invention, the genetic locus confers traits such as, for example, male sterility, waxy starch, herbicide resistance, insect resistance, resistance to bacterial, fungal, nematode or viral disease, and altered fatty acid, phytate or carbohydrate metabolism. In certain embodiments, the genetic locus that confers herbicide resistance may confer resistance to herbicides such as, for example, imidazolinone herbicides, sulfonylurea herbicides, triazine herbicides, phenoxy herbicides, cyclohexanedione herbicides, benzonitrile herbicides, 4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate dioxygenase-inhibiting herbicides, protoporphyrinogen oxidase-inhibiting herbicides, acetolactate synthase-inhibiting herbicides, 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid synthase-inhibiting herbicides, bromoxynil, nicosulfuron, 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D), dicamba, quizalofop-p-ethyl, glyphosate, or glufosinate. The genetic locus may be a naturally occurring corn gene introduced into the genome of a parent of the variety by backcrossing, a natural or induced mutation, or a transgene introduced through genetic transformation techniques. When introduced through transformation, a genetic locus may comprise one or more transgenes integrated at a single chromosomal location.\n\nIn further embodiments, a single locus conversion of one or both of the parental varieties of the hybrid corn variety CH011199 comprises a heritable genetic modification to the genome of one or both of the parental varieties. A heritable genetic modification may comprise, for example, an insertion, deletion, or substitution of a nucleotide sequence. In certain embodiments, a single locus may comprise one or more genes or intergenic regions integrated into or mutated at a single locus or may comprise one or more nucleic acid molecules integrated at the single locus. In particular embodiments, a single locus conversion may be generated by genome editing such as through use of engineered nucleases, as is known in the art. Examples of engineered nucleases include, but are not limited to, Cas endonucleases, zinc finger nucleases (ZFNs), transcription activator-like effector nucleases (TALENs), and engineered meganucleases, also known as homing endonucleases. Naturally occurring nucleases can also find use for genome editing. In specific embodiments, endonucleases, both naturally occurring and engineered, may utilize any polypeptide-, DNA-, or RNA-guided genome editing systems known to the skilled artisan.\n\nIn yet another aspect of the invention, a hybrid corn plant of the variety designated CH011199 is provided, wherein a cytoplasmically-inherited trait has been introduced into said hybrid plant. Such cytoplasmically-inherited traits are passed to progeny through the female parent in a particular cross. An exemplary cytoplasmically-inherited trait is the male sterility trait. Cytoplasmic-male sterility (CMS) is a pollen abortion phenomenon determined by the interaction between the genes in the cytoplasm and the nucleus. Alteration in the mitochondrial genome and the lack of restorer genes in the nucleus will lead to pollen abortion. With either a normal cytoplasm or the presence of restorer gene(s) in the nucleus, the plant will produce pollen normally. A CMS plant can be pollinated by a maintainer version of the same variety, which has a normal cytoplasm but lacks the restorer gene(s) in the nucleus, and continues to be male sterile in the next generation. The male fertility of a CMS plant can be restored by a restorer version of the same variety, which must have the restorer gene(s) in the nucleus. With the restorer gene(s) in the nucleus, the offspring of the male-sterile plant can produce normal pollen grains and propagate. A cytoplasmically inherited trait may be a naturally occurring maize trait or a trait introduced through genetic transformation techniques.\n\nIn another aspect of the invention, a tissue culture of regenerable cells of a plant of variety CH011199 is provided. The tissue culture will preferably be capable of regenerating plants capable of expressing all of the physiological and morphological characteristics of the variety, and of regenerating plants having substantially the same genotype as other plants of the variety. Examples of some of the physiological and morphological characteristics of the variety CH011199 include characteristics related to yield, maturity, and kernel quality, each of which is specifically disclosed herein. The regenerable cells in such tissue cultures may, for example, be derived from embryos, meristematic cells, immature tassels, microspores, pollen, leaves, anthers, roots, root tips, silk, flowers, kernels, ears, cobs, husks, or stalks, or from callus or protoplasts derived from those tissues. Still further, the present invention provides corn plants regenerated from the tissue cultures of the invention, the plants having all the physiological and morphological characteristics of variety CH011199.\n\nIn still another aspect, the invention provides a method of producing hybrid corn seed comprising crossing a plant of variety CV399035 with a plant of variety CV399333. In a cross, either parent may serve as the male or female. Processes are also provided for producing corn seeds or plants in which the processes generally comprise crossing a first parent corn plant with a second parent corn plant, wherein at least one of the first or second parent corn plants is a plant of the variety designated CH011199. In such crossing, either parent may serve as the male or female parent. These processes may be further exemplified as processes for preparing hybrid corn seed or plants, wherein a first hybrid corn plant is crossed with a second corn plant of a different, distinct variety to provide a hybrid that has, as one of its parents, the hybrid corn plant variety CH011199. In these processes, crossing will result in the production of seed. The seed production occurs regardless of whether the seed is collected or not.\n\nIn one embodiment of the invention, the first step in âcrossingâ comprises planting, often in pollinating proximity, seeds of a first and second parent corn plant, and in many cases, seeds of a first corn plant and a second, distinct corn plant. When the plants are not in pollinating proximity, pollination can nevertheless be accomplished by transferring a pollen or tassel bag from one plant to the other as described below.\n\nA second step comprises cultivating or growing the seeds of said first and second parent corn plants into plants that bear flowers (corn bears both male flowers (tassels) and female flowers (silks) in separate anatomical structures on the same plant). A third step comprises preventing self-pollination of the plants, i.e., preventing the silks of a plant from being fertilized by any plant of the same variety, including the same plant. This can be done, for example, by emasculating the male flowers of the first or second parent corn plant, (i.e., treating or manipulating the flowers so as to prevent pollen production, in order to produce an emasculated parent corn plant). Self-incompatibility systems may also be used in some hybrid crops for the same purpose. Self-incompatible plants still shed viable pollen and can pollinate plants of other varieties but are incapable of pollinating themselves or other plants of the same variety.\n\nA fourth step may comprise allowing cross-pollination to occur between the first and second parent corn plants. When the plants are not in pollinating proximity, this is done by placing a bag, usually paper or glassine, over the tassels of the first plant and another bag over the silks of the incipient ear on the second plant. The bags are left in place for at least 24 hours. Since pollen is viable for less than 24 hours, this assures that the silks are not pollinated from other pollen sources, that any stray pollen on the tassels of the first plant is no longer viable, and that the only pollen transferred comes from the first plant. The pollen bag over the tassel of the first plant is then shaken vigorously to enhance release of pollen from the tassels, and the shoot bag is removed from the silks of the incipient ear on the second plant. Finally, the pollen bag is removed from the tassel of the first plant and is placed over the silks of the incipient ear of the second plant, shaken again and left in place. Yet another step comprises harvesting the seeds from at least one of the parent corn plants. The harvested seed can be grown to produce a corn plant or hybrid corn plant.\n\nThe present invention also provides corn seed and plants produced by a process that comprises crossing a first parent corn plant with a second parent corn plant, wherein at least one of the first or second parent corn plants is a plant of the variety designated CH011199. In one embodiment of the invention, corn seed and plants produced by the process are first generation hybrid corn seed and plants produced by crossing an inbred with another, distinct inbred. The present invention further contemplates seed of an F\n\nSuch a plant can be analyzed by its âgenetic complement.â This term is used to refer to the aggregate of nucleotide sequences, the expression of which defines the phenotype of, for example, a corn plant, or a cell or tissue of that plant. A genetic complement thus represents the genetic makeup of a cell, tissue or plant. The invention thus provides corn plant cells that have a genetic complement in accordance with the corn plant cells disclosed herein, and plants, seeds and diploid plants containing such cells.\n\nPlant genetic complements may be assessed by genetic marker profiles, and by the expression of phenotypic traits that are characteristic of the expression of the genetic complement, e.g., marker typing profiles. It is known in the art that such complements may also be identified by marker types including, but not limited to, Simple Sequence Repeats (SSRs), Simple Sequence Length Polymorphisms (SSLPs) (Williams et al., \n\nIn still yet another aspect, the present invention provides hybrid genetic complements, as represented by corn plant cells, tissues, plants, and seeds, formed by the combination of a haploid genetic complement of a corn plant of the invention with a haploid genetic complement of the same or a different variety. In another aspect, the present invention provides a corn plant regenerated from a tissue culture that comprises a hybrid genetic complement of this invention.\n",

    "description": "\n\nFIELD OF THE INVENTION\n\n\nThe invention that is the subject of the patent application is in the field of means used for gardening and growing plantsâpots, planters and greenhouses, especially in the field of these means intended for the household marketâgardening enthusiasts as opposed to horticulturalists.\n\n\nBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION\n\n\nThe growing urbanization of large populations of people living cities in high rises juxtaposed with the desire to âreturn to natureâ and eat organic food has boosted the trend of growing ornamental plants, herbs and vegetables in flowerpots, planters and household greenhouses by people who are not professional gardeners or horticulturalists, but enthusiasts wishing to take advantage of the limited space on the balconies of their small apartments for growing and cultivating plants by themselves as a hobby or way for families to spend time together. At the same time, this population, which has already become accustomed and skilled in assembling furniture and household items (e.g. IKEA products), is not deterred by âdo it yourselfâ (DIY) challenges to which it is exposed on specialized marketing networks, and are even eager to do this in their spare time.\n\nTherefore, prior to the present invention, there was a demand for self-assembly kits that will enable this population to fulfill its aspirations of growing ornamental plants, herbs and vegetables at home. At the same time and from the point of view of planners, manufacturers and distributors of potted plants, planters and home greenhouses, properly addressing this need calls for a design that is scalable, with a minimum of components, relatively inexpensive, and utilizes existing and proven technologies (e.g. mass production by injection molding of plastic components). The design should also enable packaging, shipping, storage and marketing of a compact kit (when disassembled) and its simple and quick assembly on-site by the end customer on the balcony of his apartment in a residential high-rise or in the yard of a single-story home (without requiring technicians or other professionals).\n\n\nSUMMARY OF THE INVENTION\n\n\nThe invention, which is the subject of the patent application, addresses the challenges described above.\n\nIn one aspect, the invention is embodied in a modular multi-tiered planter kit. A kit whose basic elements comprise two support elements that are suitable for placing on a surface (e.g. on a balcony floor of an apartment or in the yard of a home), perpendicular to the surface and spaced from each other, as well as a number of planter assemblies that are fitted for connection in a disassemblable mounting, with the two support elements in a multi-tier configuration, each extending in an essentially horizontal direction in the gap between the two support elements.\n\nThe kit according to the invention is characterized in that once mounted as said; it offers the customer a variety of design and usage options. The modular multi-tiered kit according to the invention can be marketed and mounted in a wide array of different types of planter assemblies that can be mounted in conjunction or separately, which include different plant growth substrates (e.g. soil, mixture, substrate bags, water (for hydroponic cultivation)).\n\nIn a modular multi-tiered planter kit according to the invention, the various types of planter assemblies all comprise a unified planter element that is used in each of the planter assemblies, but as stated, this element may make up a âbuilding blockâ and be used in a wide array of diverse planter assemblies. The group comprises:\n\n\nMoreover, a modular multi-tiered planter kit according to the invention can also comprise multiple side planters that are fitted for mounting on the support elements, also in a multi-tier configuration, while they are positioned on the outer side of the support elements. In another and additional aspect, the side planter assemblies may be of a type that also allows for retrieving from time to time an inner basket from them, in a way that allows for manual access to the roots growing inside.\n\nIn another and additional aspect, a modular multi-tiered planter kit may also comprise a coverage means for removable cover of the mounted kit, and an array of spacer means which are mountable in a disassemblable fashion on the planter assemblies, so that from the time the coverage means is spread and the kit is covered by it, the coverage means is positioned for contact with the array of the spacer means, and is therefore spaced from the mounted kit (which may impart to the kit according to the invention a quasi-greenhouse capacity and protect the plants growing inside it from the ravages of the weather).\n\nIn another and additional aspect, a modular multi-tiered planter kit according to the invention may also comprise means for physically drawing the boundaries between various plants sprouting from the planter assemblies in the kit.\n\nIn another and additional aspect, a modular multi-tiered planter kit according to the invention may also comprise a system for irrigating the planter assemblies mounted therein (of the various types). An irrigation system that as usual comprises a water storage container, a pumping device for pumping water from the container, and an array of pipes for routing the pumped water to the plant growth substrates in the planter assemblies. However, the irrigation system according to the invention is characterized in that the water container is formed in a way that is mountable in the modular multi-tiered planter kit in a similar fashion as the way in which the planter assembly is mounted in the kit, and a unified planter element may be used as said container.\n\nIn another and additional aspect, the invention is embodied in a water bottle that is mountable for example and as aforesaid in a modular multi-tiered planter kit according to the invention, in the second-type, third-type and fourth-type planter assemblies, and comprises a mechanism that enables turning the bottle completely upside down, as needed to mount it, without water leaking from it, and it opens by itself to the passage of water from it, once it is mounted.\n\nIn another aspect, the unified planter element that serves all the different planter assemblies indicated above, from the first type to the fifth type (inclusive), is designed differently than the unified design, which, as stated, serves as a âbuilding blockâ in all the aforesaid planter assemblies. A different design that does not detract from the planter's ability to similarly connect in a disassemblable mounting with the two support elements in a modular multi-tiered mounting according to the invention, parallel to a unified planter element (one or more), parallel to said planter assemblies of the first to fifth (inclusive) or separately and independently.\n\nThe different planter may be used in another and additional assembly of plantersâa sixth-type planter assembly. A sixth-type planter assembly, wherein each planter comprising a planter element, wherein both ends are formed similar to the unified planter element (in a manner, as stated, that enables its disassemblable connection to the two support elements), but has a depression along its length, and on which a cover element is mounted in a disassemblable manner, and is formed with at least one bracket that from the time the cover element is mounted on the planter, is positioned at one end of the planter element and allows for mounting a water bottle inside it, and with at least one bracket that allows for mounting a pot plant inside it; an internal water container that is suitable for mounting inside the planter element; and an electrically-powered pump that is suitable for mounting at the said one end of the planter element and is connected for pumping of water flowing from said bottle, and streams them through a pipe system that extends from said one end of the planter element, along the planter element, to the other end of said planter element, and into said internal water container element.\n\nOther aspects, other configurations and advantages of the modular multi-tiered planter kit will be described below. It should be borne in mind that the configurations described below may be combined with other configurations in different ways, which are at least consistent with one of the principles of the invention described below, and the terminology used here should not be construed as limiting in any way.\n",

    "description": "\n\nSTATEMENT REGARDING FEDERALLY SPONSORED RESEARCH OR DEVELOPMENT\n\n\nNot Applicable.\n\n\nREFERENCE TO A MICROFICHE APPENDIX\n\n\nNot Applicable.\n\n\nBACKGROUND\n\n\n\nTechnical Field\n\n\nExemplary embodiment(s) of the present disclosure relate to feline potty-training device and, more particularly, to a kitty water loo including a plurality of selectively removable litter trays that progressively and chronologically provide greater access to a water reservoir for teaching a cat to go potty in the water reservoir rather than a litter box.\n\n\nPrior Art\n\n\nMany pets, especially cats, can be trained to use a litterbox. However, litter boxes must be cleaned, and the litter periodically changed. Litter can be accidentally moved out of the litter box by a cat and litter boxes can emit unappealing smells. This leads to a number of disadvantages, including odor, and the need to regularly remove feces. It is for these reasons that many cat owners prefer options other than litter boxes. The most obvious choice, other than a litterbox, is to train a cat to go to the bathroom exterior. However, for many people, such a choice is not possible. Many people do not have the time in their schedules to walk their cats at necessary times. Furthermore, many cats cannot be trained to safely roam free outdoors.\n\nMoreover, an upset cat will not use the litter box. Because cats are naturally fastidious, it is hard to keep that area consistently clean and fresh. Cats are meticulously clean and cannot tolerate the smell or feel of a dirty box. If a cat cannot find a clean place to dig, the cat is out of there.\n\nFurthermore, the average cost for litter annually is $300 or more. The money spent on litter accessories for cleanup and odor control can add-up. Household cleaning and food safety problems are caused by scattering litter and litter dust caught between the paws and body fur as well as urine and feces particles throughout the home as well as cooking, eating, and sleeping areas cannot be prevented by litter catcher mats.\n\nElectro-mechanical litter systems do not work during a power outage and have to be plugged into an available outlet. Unlike the present disclosure they have a limited life spam, they can break down and jam up plus when it comes time to cleaning one it usually is not easy. Some of these devices have to use expensive cartridges and chemicals instead of water.\n\nAccordingly, a need remains for a kitty water loo in order to overcome at least one aforementioned shortcoming. The exemplary embodiment(s) satisfy such a need by providing a kitty water loo including a plurality of selectively removable litter trays that is convenient and easy to use, lightweight yet durable in design, versatile in its applications, and configured for progressively and chronologically providing greater access to a water reservoir for teaching a cat to go potty in the water reservoir rather than a litter box.\n\n\nBRIEF SUMMARY OF NON-LIMITING EXEMPLARY EMBODIMENT(S) OF THE PRESENT DISCLOSURE\n\n\nIn view of the foregoing background, it is therefore an object of the non-limiting exemplary embodiment(s) to provide a kitty water loo including a plurality of selectively removable litter trays that progressively and chronologically provide greater access to a water reservoir for teaching a cat to go potty in the water reservoir rather than a litter box. These and other objects, features, and advantages of the non-limiting exemplary embodiment(s) are provided by a kitty water loo for self-training a cat to potty in water. The kitty water loo includes a main housing, a basin removably seated within the main housing and being configured to contain water therein, a lid removably positioned onto the main housing above the basin, and a plurality of litter trays adjustably arranged in a concentrically stacked configuration and supported by the lid above the basin. Advantageously, the litter trays are configured to contain cat litter therein and further configured to be chronologically removed one-by-one such that the water is progressively exposed in the basin therebelow. Advantageously, the concentrically stacked configuration extends downwardly and inwardly towards the basin.\n\nIn a non-limiting exemplary embodiment, the basin includes at least one of: a drawer being removably inserted into the main housing and being configured to hold water therein, and a reservoir being removably disposed within the drawer and being configured to hold water therein.\n\nIn a non-limiting exemplary embodiment, the main housing is free-standing and portable. The main housing includes a central cavity configured to entirely contain the drawer and the reservoir therein, and an outer wall including an aperture configured to slidably receive the drawer along a horizontal bi-directional travel path relative to a central longitudinal axis of the main housing.\n\nIn a non-limiting exemplary embodiment, the main housing has an open top end configured to vertically receive the reservoir seated within the drawer. Such a drawer has a first friction member slidably and frictionally engaged with a second friction member of the main housing.\n\nIn a non-limiting exemplary embodiment, the lid has a circular shape provided with a central aperture vertically aligned along a central longitudinal axis of the main housing. Notably, an outer peripheral edge of the lid is supported about the open top end of the main housing.\n\nIn a non-limiting exemplary embodiment, the litter trays includes a first litter tray being concentrically seated directly on the lid and having a first central opening vertically aligned above the reservoir.\n\nIn a non-limiting exemplary embodiment, the litter trays further includes a second litter tray being concentrically seated directly on the first litter tray and having a second central opening vertically aligned above the reservoir.\n\nIn a non-limiting exemplary embodiment, the litter trays further includes a third litter tray being concentrically seated directly on the second litter tray and having a third central opening vertically aligned above the reservoir.\n\nIn a non-limiting exemplary embodiment, the litter trays further includes a fourth litter tray being concentrically seated directly on the third litter tray and having a fourth central opening vertically aligned above the reservoir.\n\nIn a non-limiting exemplary embodiment, the litter trays further includes a fifth litter tray being concentrically seated directly the fourth litter tray and having a solid bottom surface vertically aligned above the reservoir.\n\nThere has thus been outlined, rather broadly, the more important features of non-limiting exemplary embodiment(s) of the present disclosure so that the following detailed description may be better understood, and that the present contribution to the relevant art(s) may be better appreciated. There are additional features of the non-limiting exemplary embodiment(s) of the present disclosure that will be described hereinafter and which will form the subject matter of the claims appended hereto.\n",

    "description": "\n\nCROSS REFERENCE TO THE RELATED APPLICATIONS\n\n\nThis application is the national phase entry of International Application No. PCT/CN2020/076873, filed on Feb. 27, 2020, which is based upon and claims priority to Chinese Patent Applications No. 201910521541.1, filed on Jun. 17, 2019; No. 201910851196.8, filed on Sep. 10, 2019; No. 201921503099.1, filed on Sep. 10, 2019; the entire contents of which are incorporated herein by reference.\n\n\nTECHNICAL FIELD\n\n\nThe present disclosure relates to a pet comb. In particular, the present disclosure relates to a pet comb suitable for combing, disentangling and/or thinning the hair/fur of a pet.\n\n\nBACKGROUND\n\n\nMore and more modern households are increasing their appetite for incorporating pets into their homes. With the introduction of pets, an important factor for sufficiently caring for the pet is to groom and manage their hair/fur that may inevitably be shed or become entangled.\n\nVarious devices exist for grooming the hair/fur of pets in order to manage shedding or neatly disentangling said hair, such as brushes, combs, scissors and razors. Each of these devices are typically adapted for a specific purpose such as to brush hair, comb hair, clean up shed hair, thin hair or cut hair. In addition to these devices, there are also devices that are used to perform more than one purpose, such as to perform the combined action of both brush hair and clean up shed hair. Often, such âcombination devicesâ include a combing portion and one or more blade for shaving hair.\n\nThese devices struggle with combing the pet hair when it is entangled, causing the combination device to become stuck, cause discomfort to the pet and prevent a user from successfully grooming the pet. Additionally these devices, particularly those including one or more blade for shaving hair, present a hazard to both the pet and the user due to their edge that may cause a cut/laceration when used incorrectly (such as at an inappropriate angle) or in error.\n\nIt would be advantageous to provide a device suitable for combing, disentangling and/or thinning the hair/fur of a pet that minimises chances of becoming stuck when the pet hair is entangled, and is not hazardous to either the pet or the user if used incorrectly or in error.\n\nIt is against this background and the problems and difficulties associated therewith, that the present disclosure has been developed.\n\n\nSUMMARY\n\n\nThe technical problem to be solved by the present disclosure is to provide a pet comb that avoids cutting the pet's skin or the user's hand. The pet comb can also selectively provide a hair combing function, or a function or hair disentanglement and thinning.\n\nAnother technical problem to be solved by the present disclosure is to provide a pet comb that avoids cutting the user's hand without affecting the efficiency of hair combing, disentanglement or thinning.\n\nThe technical solutions adopted by the present disclosure to solve the above technical problems are: a pet comb comprises a handle, a mounting head and a comb body; wherein the comb body comprises a row of striped comb teeth; wherein a blade side of the striped comb teeth comprises a combing portion disposed at an outer section and a blade portion disposed at an inner section; wherein the striped comb teeth are provided with a blade blocking portion extending in a direction of the striped comb teeth on the blade side; whereby at least part of the combing portion exceeds the free end of the blade blocking portion, and the blade blocking portion blocks at least part of the blade portion.\n\nAccording to a first aspect, there is provided a pet comb, comprising: a handle, a mounting head and a comb body; wherein the comb body comprises a row of striped comb teeth; wherein a blade side of the striped comb teeth comprises a combing portion disposed at an outer section and a blade portion disposed at an inner section; wherein the striped comb teeth are provided with a blade blocking portion extending in a direction of the striped comb teeth on the blade side; whereby at least part of the combing portion exceeds the free end of the blade blocking portion, and the blade blocking portion blocks at least part of the blade portion.\n\nIn one form, the free end of the blade blocking portion exceeds a boundary of the combing portion and the blade portion; or the free end of the blade blocking portion does not exceed the boundary of the combing portion and the blade portion.\n\nIn one form, the blade blocking portion is fixed or movable, wherein an extending length of the movable blade blocking portion is adjustable.\n\nIn one form, the blade blocking portion is fixedly or movably disposed on a hair removal plate or the mounting head.\n\nIn one form, the blade blocking portion and the blade portion are separated by a distance, and the blade blocking portion is configured so as to prevent a user from being injured or cut by the blade portion.\n\nIn one form, the blade blocking portion is a blade blocking plate connected to the hair removal plate by a connecting portion.\n\nIn one form, the blade blocking plate extends in parallel with the striped comb teeth.\n\nIn one form, the hair removal plate is integrated with the blade blocking plate, wherein the hair removal plate and the blade blocking plate is made of plastic, metal or other materials.\n\nIn one form, the pet comb further comprises a restriction portion, wherein the restriction portion is provided on an alternate side of the striped comb teeth, and the restriction portion and the free end of the blade blocking portion together restrict hair and an inner end of the blade portion.\n\nIn one form, the restriction portion is fixedly or movably disposed on the mounting head, the comb body or the hair removal plate.\n\nIn one form, relative positions of the blade portion, the restriction portion and the blade blocking portion are adjustable and fixable.\n\nIn one form, the restriction portion is integrated with the hair removal plate, wherein the hair removal plate and the blade blocking plate are made of plastic, metal or other materials.\n\nIn one form, the blade portion is disposed at an inner side of a connection line between a free end of the restriction portion and the free end of the blade blocking portion, while the combing portion still exceeds the blade blocking portion.\n\nAccording to a second aspect, there is provided a pet comb comprising: a handle, a mounting head and a comb body; wherein the comb body comprises a row of striped comb teeth; wherein a blade portion is provided on a rear side of the striped comb teeth; wherein the striped comb teeth are provided with a blade blocking portion extending in a direction of the striped comb teeth on the side with the blade portion; whereby a plurality of hair channels allow hair to enter gaps among the combing teeth and having the same direction as the striped teeth are provided on the blade blocking portion.\n\nIn one form, a width of the plurality of hair channels equals to the width of at least one of the combing teeth.\n\nIn one form, the blade portion is distributed on at least part of the rear side of the striped comb.\n\nIn one form, a free end of the blade blocking portion does not exceed a free end of the striped comb.\n\nIn one form, a blade side of the striped comb teeth comprises a combing portion disposed at an outer section of the blade portion disposed at an inner section, wherein the free end of the blade blocking portion exceeds a boundary of the combing portion and the blade portion; or the free end of the blade blocking portion does not exceed the boundary of the combing portion and the blade portion.\n\nIn one form, the blade blocking portion is fixed or movable, wherein an extending length of the movable blade blocking portion is adjustable.\n\nIn one form, the blade blocking portion is fixedly or movably disposed on a hair removal plate or the mounting head.\n\nIn one form, the blade blocking portion and the blade portion are separated by a distance.\n\nIn one form, the blade blocking portion is a blade blocking plate connected to the hair removal plate by a connecting portion.\n\nIn one form, the blade blocking plate extends in parallel with the striped combing teeth.\n\nIn one form, the hair removal plate is integrated with the blade blocking plate, wherein the hair removal plate and the blade blocking plate are made of plastic, metal or other materials.\n",

    "description": "\n\nINCORPORATION OF SEQUENCE LISTING\n\n\nA sequence listing contained in the file named âP34709U00_SL.txtâ which is 2,780,525 bytes (measured in MS-WindowsÂ®) and created on Jan. 11, 2019, is filed electronically herewith and incorporated by reference in its entirety.\n\n\nFIELD\n\n\nThe present disclosure provides a low alkaloid-associated chromosomal deletion region (LA_associated_region), a tobacco Nic1b locus, and genes in or around the region or locus. Also provided are tobacco plants with altered total alkaloid and nicotine levels and commercially acceptable leaf grade, their development via breeding or transgenic approaches, and production of tobacco products from these tobacco plants.\n\n\nBACKGROUND\n\n\nFour major alkaloids are found in tobacco: nicotine, nomicotine, anabasine, and anatabine. Nicotine is the predominant alkaloid, usually accounting for more than 90% of the total alkaloids in commercial tobacco cultivars. Nicotine biosynthesis occurs predominantly in tobacco roots. Tobacco plants then transport nicotine through the vascular bundle to leaves where nicotine is then stored in the vacuoles.\n\nA variety of factors affect tobacco alkaloid levels including genotype, environment, fertilization, and agronomic practices (for example, nicotine production is stimulated by topping, wounding, and herbivore damage). Low-alkaloid traits initially found in strains of Cuban cigar tobacco varieties were introduced into cigarette varieties through a series of backcrosses. Low-alkaloid tobacco germplasm was subsequently registered in the genetic background of cultivar Burley 21 (Legg et al., \n\nReducing total alkaloid content in tobacco can have many benefits. It can increase the value of tobacco as a biomass resource. Increases in nicotinic alkaloid in tobacco plants may play an important role in protecting plants against insects and herbivores.\n\nConsistent with alkaloids' role in insect defense, LA BU21 was reported to be extremely susceptible to insect damage (Legg et al., \n\nThere is a need to identify genes that regulate tobacco nicotine levels, and to develop tobacco plants and products that contain altered nicotine levels (e.g., reduced nicotine) while maintaining (if not making superior) tobacco leaf quality.\n\n\nSUMMARY\n\n\nIn an aspect, the present disclosure provides tobacco plants, or part thereof, comprising a mutation in a Nic1b_ERF locus, where the tobacco plants are capable of producing leaves, when cured, having a USDA grade index value of 50 or more.\n\nIn another aspect, the present disclosure provides tobacco plants, or part thereof, comprising a mutation in a Nic1b_ERF locus and a mutation in Nic2 locus, where the tobacco plants are capable of producing leaves, when cured, having a USDA grade index value comparable to that of a control plant when grown in similar growth conditions, where the control plant shares an essentially identical genetic background with the tobacco plant except the mutation.\n\nIn an aspect, the present disclosure further provides non-transgenic tobacco plants, or part thereof, comprising a nicotine level selected from the group consisting of less than 2.0%, where the tobacco plants are capable of producing leaves, when cured, having a USDA grade index value of 50 or more.\n\nIn another aspect, the present disclosure also provides a tobacco plant, or part thereof, comprising a non-transgenic mutation in a Nic1b_ERF locus, where the non-transgenic mutation reduces the nicotine level of the tobacco plant to about 20% or less of the nicotine level of a control plant when grown in similar growth conditions, where the tobacco plant is capable of producing leaves, when cured, having a USDA grade index value comparable to the USDA grade index value of the control plant, and where the control plant shares an essentially identical genetic background with the tobacco plant except the non-transgenic mutation.\n\nIn an aspect, the present disclosure provides tobacco plants, or part thereof, comprising a mutation in a Nic1b_ERF locus, where the tobacco plant comprise a similar level of one or more tobacco aroma compounds selected from the group consisting of 3-methylvaleric acid, valeric acid, isovaleric acid, a labdenoid, a cembrenoid, a sugar ester, and a reducing sugar, compared to a control tobacco plant when grown in similar growth conditions.\n\nIn another aspect, the present disclosure provides tobacco plants, or part thereof, comprising a mutation in a Nic1b_ERF locus, where the mutation is absent from LA Burley 21.

    "description": "\n\nBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n\nField of the Invention\n\n\nThe present invention relates generally to the field of corn breeding. In particular, the invention relates to corn seed and plants of the hybrid variety designated CH011177, and derivatives and tissue cultures thereof.\n\n\nDescription of Related Art\n\n\nThe goal of field crop breeding is to combine various desirable traits in a single variety/hybrid. Such desirable traits include greater yield, better stalks, better roots, resistance to insecticides, herbicides, pests, and disease, tolerance to heat and drought, reduced time to crop maturity, better agronomic quality, higher nutritional value, and uniformity in germination times, stand establishment, growth rate, maturity, and fruit size.\n\nPlant breeding techniques take advantage of how a plant is naturally pollinated. There are two general methods of pollination. A plant is self-pollinated when pollen from one flower is transferred to the same flower or another flower of the same plant. A plant is cross-pollinated when pollen comes to it from a flower of a different plant.\n\nCorn plants (\n\nPlants that have been self-pollinated and selected for type over many generations become homozygous at almost all gene loci and produce a uniform population of true breeding progeny, i.e., a homozygous plant. A cross between two such homozygous plants produces a uniform population of hybrid plants that are heterozygous for many gene loci and phenotypically uniform.\n\nThe development of uniform corn plant hybrids requires developing homozygous inbred plants, crossing these inbred plants, and evaluating these crosses. Pedigree breeding and recurrent selection are examples of breeding methods used to develop hybrid parent plants from breeding populations. Those breeding methods combine the genetic backgrounds from two or more inbred plants or various other broad-based sources into breeding pools from which new inbred plants are developed by selfing combined with phenotypic or genotypic selection. The new inbred plants are crossed with other inbred plants and the hybrids produced by these crosses are evaluated for commercial potential.\n\nNorth American farmers plant tens of millions of acres of corn at the present time and there are extensive national and international commercial corn breeding programs. A continuing goal of these corn breeding programs is to develop corn hybrids that are based on stable inbred plants and have one or more desirable characteristics. To accomplish this goal, the corn breeder must select and develop superior inbred parental plants.\n\n\nSUMMARY OF THE INVENTION\n\n\nIn one aspect, the present invention provides a corn plant of the hybrid variety designated CH011177. Also provided are corn plants having all the physiological and morphological characteristics of the hybrid corn variety CH011177. A hybrid corn plant of the invention may further comprise a cytoplasmic or nuclear factor that is capable of conferring male sterility or otherwise preventing self-pollination, such as by self-incompatibility. Parts of the corn plant of the present invention are also provided, for example, pollen obtained from a hybrid plant and an ovule of the hybrid plant. The invention also concerns seed of the hybrid corn variety CH011177. The hybrid corn seed of the invention may be provided as a population of corn seed of the variety designated CH011177.\n\nIn a further aspect, the invention provides a composition comprising a seed of corn variety CH011177 comprised in plant seed growth media. In certain embodiments, the plant seed growth media is a soil or synthetic cultivation medium. In specific embodiments, the growth medium may be comprised in a container or may, for example, be soil in a field.\n\nIn another aspect of the invention, the hybrid corn variety CH011177 comprising an added heritable trait or genetic modification is provided. The heritable trait may comprise a genetic locus that comprises a dominant or recessive allele. In certain embodiments of the invention, the genetic locus confers traits such as, for example, male sterility, waxy starch, herbicide resistance, insect resistance, resistance to bacterial, fungal, nematode or viral disease, and altered fatty acid, phytate or carbohydrate metabolism. In certain embodiments, the genetic locus that confers herbicide resistance may confer resistance to herbicides such as, for example, imidazolinone herbicides, sulfonylurea herbicides, triazine herbicides, phenoxy herbicides, cyclohexanedione herbicides, benzonitrile herbicides, 4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate dioxygenase-inhibiting herbicides, protoporphyrinogen oxidase-inhibiting herbicides, acetolactate synthase-inhibiting herbicides, 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid synthase-inhibiting herbicides, bromoxynil, nicosulfuron, 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D), dicamba, quizalofop-p-ethyl, glyphosate, or glufosinate. The genetic locus may be a naturally occurring corn gene introduced into the genome of a parent of the variety by backcrossing, a natural or induced mutation, or a transgene introduced through genetic transformation techniques. When introduced through transformation, a genetic locus may comprise one or more transgenes integrated at a single chromosomal location.\n\nIn further embodiments, a single locus conversion of one or both of the parental varieties of the hybrid corn variety CH011177 comprises a heritable genetic modification to the genome of one or both of the parental varieties. A heritable genetic modification may comprise, for example, an insertion, deletion, or substitution of a nucleotide sequence. In certain embodiments, a single locus may comprise one or more genes or intergenic regions integrated into or mutated at a single locus or may comprise one or more nucleic acid molecules integrated at the single locus. In particular embodiments, a single locus conversion may be generated by genome editing such as through use of engineered nucleases, as is known in the art. Examples of engineered nucleases include, but are not limited to, Cas endonucleases, zinc finger nucleases (ZFNs), transcription activator-like effector nucleases (TALENs), and engineered meganucleases, also known as homing endonucleases. Naturally occurring nucleases can also find use for genome editing. In specific embodiments, endonucleases, both naturally occurring and engineered, may utilize any polypeptide-, DNA-, or RNA-guided genome editing systems known to the skilled artisan.\n\nIn yet another aspect of the invention, a hybrid corn plant of the variety designated CH011177 is provided, wherein a cytoplasmically-inherited trait has been introduced into said hybrid plant. Such cytoplasmically-inherited traits are passed to progeny through the female parent in a particular cross. An exemplary cytoplasmically-inherited trait is the male sterility trait. Cytoplasmic-male sterility (CMS) is a pollen abortion phenomenon determined by the interaction between the genes in the cytoplasm and the nucleus. Alteration in the mitochondrial genome and the lack of restorer genes in the nucleus will lead to pollen abortion. With either a normal cytoplasm or the presence of restorer gene(s) in the nucleus, the plant will produce pollen normally. A CMS plant can be pollinated by a maintainer version of the same variety, which has a normal cytoplasm but lacks the restorer gene(s) in the nucleus, and continues to be male sterile in the next generation. The male fertility of a CMS plant can be restored by a restorer version of the same variety, which must have the restorer gene(s) in the nucleus. With the restorer gene(s) in the nucleus, the offspring of the male-sterile plant can produce normal pollen grains and propagate. A cytoplasmically inherited trait may be a naturally occurring maize trait or a trait introduced through genetic transformation techniques.\n\nIn another aspect of the invention, a tissue culture of regenerable cells of a plant of variety CH011177 is provided. The tissue culture will preferably be capable of regenerating plants capable of expressing all of the physiological and morphological characteristics of the variety, and of regenerating plants having substantially the same genotype as other plants of the variety. Examples of some of the physiological and morphological characteristics of the variety CH011177 include characteristics related to yield, maturity, and kernel quality, each of which is specifically disclosed herein. The regenerable cells in such tissue cultures may, for example, be derived from embryos, meristematic cells, immature tassels, microspores, pollen, leaves, anthers, roots, root tips, silk, flowers, kernels, ears, cobs, husks, or stalks, or from callus or protoplasts derived from those tissues. Still further, the present invention provides corn plants regenerated from the tissue cultures of the invention, the plants having all the physiological and morphological characteristics of variety CH011177.\n\nIn still another aspect, the invention provides a method of producing hybrid corn seed comprising crossing a plant of variety CV602186 with a plant of variety CV644326. In a cross, either parent may serve as the male or female. Processes are also provided for producing corn seeds or plants in which the processes generally comprise crossing a first parent corn plant with a second parent corn plant, wherein at least one of the first or second parent corn plants is a plant of the variety designated CH011177. In such crossing, either parent may serve as the male or female parent. These processes may be further exemplified as processes for preparing hybrid corn seed or plants, wherein a first hybrid corn plant is crossed with a second corn plant of a different, distinct variety to provide a hybrid that has, as one of its parents, the hybrid corn plant variety CH011177. In these processes, crossing will result in the production of seed. The seed production occurs regardless of whether the seed is collected or not.\n\nIn one embodiment of the invention, the first step in âcrossingâ comprises planting, often in pollinating proximity, seeds of a first and second parent corn plant, and in many cases, seeds of a first corn plant and a second, distinct corn plant. When the plants are not in pollinating proximity, pollination can nevertheless be accomplished by transferring a pollen or tassel bag from one plant to the other as described below.\n\nA second step comprises cultivating or growing the seeds of said first and second parent corn plants into plants that bear flowers (corn bears both male flowers (tassels) and female flowers (silks) in separate anatomical structures on the same plant). A third step comprises preventing self-pollination of the plants, i.e., preventing the silks of a plant from being fertilized by any plant of the same variety, including the same plant. This can be done, for example, by emasculating the male flowers of the first or second parent corn plant, (i.e., treating or manipulating the flowers so as to prevent pollen production, in order to produce an emasculated parent corn plant). Self-incompatibility systems may also be used in some hybrid crops for the same purpose. Self-incompatible plants still shed viable pollen and can pollinate plants of other varieties but are incapable of pollinating themselves or other plants of the same variety.\n\nA fourth step may comprise allowing cross-pollination to occur between the first and second parent corn plants. When the plants are not in pollinating proximity, this is done by placing a bag, usually paper or glassine, over the tassels of the first plant and another bag over the silks of the incipient ear on the second plant. The bags are left in place for at least 24 hours. Since pollen is viable for less than 24 hours, this assures that the silks are not pollinated from other pollen sources, that any stray pollen on the tassels of the first plant is no longer viable, and that the only pollen transferred comes from the first plant. The pollen bag over the tassel of the first plant is then shaken vigorously to enhance release of pollen from the tassels, and the shoot bag is removed from the silks of the incipient ear on the second plant. Finally, the pollen bag is removed from the tassel of the first plant and is placed over the silks of the incipient ear of the second plant, shaken again and left in place. Yet another step comprises harvesting the seeds from at least one of the parent corn plants. The harvested seed can be grown to produce a corn plant or hybrid corn plant.\n\nThe present invention also provides corn seed and plants produced by a process that comprises crossing a first parent corn plant with a second parent corn plant, wherein at least one of the first or second parent corn plants is a plant of the variety designated CH011177. In one embodiment of the invention, corn seed and plants produced by the process are first generation hybrid corn seed and plants produced by crossing an inbred with another, distinct inbred. The present invention further contemplates seed of an F\n\nSuch a plant can be analyzed by its âgenetic complement.â This term is used to refer to the aggregate of nucleotide sequences, the expression of which defines the phenotype of, for example, a corn plant, or a cell or tissue of that plant. A genetic complement thus represents the genetic makeup of a cell, tissue or plant. The invention thus provides corn plant cells that have a genetic complement in accordance with the corn plant cells disclosed herein, and plants, seeds and diploid plants containing such cells.\n\nPlant genetic complements may be assessed by genetic marker profiles, and by the expression of phenotypic traits that are characteristic of the expression of the genetic complement, e.g., marker typing profiles. It is known in the art that such complements may also be identified by marker types including, but not limited to, Simple Sequence Repeats (SSRs), Simple Sequence Length Polymorphisms (SSLPs) (Williams et al., \n\nIn still yet another aspect, the present invention provides hybrid genetic complements, as represented by corn plant cells, tissues, plants, and seeds, formed by the combination of a haploid genetic complement of a corn plant of the invention with a haploid genetic complement of the same or a different variety. In another aspect, the present invention provides a corn plant regenerated from a tissue culture that comprises a hybrid genetic complement of this invention.\n",

    "description": "\n\nBACKGROUND\n\n\nRotational grazing of livestock is well understood within the literature to have many benefits including building soil health while feeing a herd of animals. Rotational grazing can also promote a uniform distribution of manure while preventing overgrazing, which damages the soil and causes erosion.\n\nHowever, rotational grazing can be very labor-intensive because herds of animals need to be moved as quickly as every few hours to new grazing sources.\n\nWhat is needed is a robotic system that automatically moves a herd of grazing animals based on GPS coordinates obtained by robot machines positioned on an area of land for grazing animals.\n\n\nSUMMARY OF THE PRESENT DISCLOSURE\n\n\nInstead of a fence having all conventional static or fixed fence posts dug into the ground, disclosed herein is a robotically controlled system including a fence enclosure that can move and/or shape-shift itself autonomously and automatically without manual intervention. The system includes coils of electric fence wire that are spring-loaded or otherwise tensioned so that the length of electric fence wire between each post robot is able to contract or expand as the system of robots adapts to optimize the shape of the fence enclosure as the entire enclosure is moved by the robots around a field or other grazing pasture on an area of land.\n",

    "abstract": "A method of making an extruded granular absorbent is provided where the method includes providing an extruder and a starch-containing admixture, and pressurizing the starch containing admixture in the extruder under relatively high extrusion pressures to extrude the pressurized starch-containing admixture from the extruder, and producing a water absorbent and oil absorbent extrudate. The present invention further provides that the extruded granular absorbent may be combined with a non-extruded granular material with relatively high inert or cellulose content where there may be a greater proportion of extruded granular absorbent, and the extruded granular absorbent and non-extruded granular material agglutinate into a clump when wetted with water or urine.\n\n",
    "description": "\n\nFIELD\n\n\nThe present invention is directed to an optimized system and method for making extruded granular absorbent and more particularly to a system and method of making extruded granular absorbent under relatively high extrusion pressures producing more repeatably consistent absorbent extrudate. The present invention is further directed to a self-clumping granular absorbent blend of extruded granular absorbent and non-extruded granular filler, and more particularly to such a granular absorbent product composed of a blend having a high-percentage of non-extruded granular filler blended with extruded granular absorbent.\n\n\nBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION\n\n\nLitters have evolved over the centuries, utilizing materials such as ash, paper, sand, sawdust, and other mediums into the modern era, where clay has become a centerpiece. Clay is a relatively dirt cheap option for litter usage, although it is also a relatively heavy product with potentially hazardous airborne dust containing crystalline silica.\n\nDue to the heavy, hazardous, and non-biodegrading nature of this mainstream product, there has been a push by consumers for the industry to create a lighter, clumping, natural, biodegradable, renewably resourced, non-dusting, and economical option to use.\n\nWhile historical attempts have been made to create lighter clumping litters through extruded blend combinations containing starch, none of those attempts have maximized the properties of starch that allows for the production of a clumping absorbent litter that can start from a single raw starch material and result in a stand-alone derivative that clumps without adding other ingredients. Other attempts to utilize starch based extruded materials for litter purposes have focused on the addition of starch material as a lightweight diluent that has plasticity forming dynamics through extrusion; the starch provides a medium that could be extruded and pelletized, while requiring other materials such as clay, polymers, or gums to be present in order to obtain clumping properties.\n\nThe present invention has maximized the properties of starch in ways that have not been applied before, yielding a product that is lightweight, natural, biodegradable, and self-clumping; a product that is so strong in performance, its activity can be diluted by other non-clumping carriers and diluents while still meeting the high expectations that the public has been looking for.\n\nIn addition, while many attempts have been made in the past to produce granular absorbent through extrusion of starch-containing material, very few have been commercially successful to date. This includes past efforts to produce an extruded granular absorbent well suited for use as animal, pet or cat litter.\n\nExamples of such prior efforts to make extruded litter are disclosed in Sotillo, U.S. Pat. No. 6,220,206 (â'206 patentâ), Fuchshuber, U.S. Patent Application Publication No. US 20100269758 A1 (â'758 publicationâ), and Dixon et al., U.S. Patent Application Publication No. US 20110185977 A1 (â'977 publicationâ). While each reference discloses a method of making extruded granular absorbent that purports to be suitable for use as cat, pet or animal litter, post-extrusion conditions including post-extrusion processing disclosed in each reference adversely affects one or more characteristics and/or properties of the litter undesirably adversely impacting performance of the litter.\n\nThe '206 patent discloses extruding an admixture composed of grain milling byproducts containing enough starch to form at least 30% gelatinized starch in each extruded pellet during extrusion with the gelatinized starch serving as a binder that keeps each extruded pellet from breaking apart. After extrusion, the '206 patent further discloses milling of the extruded pellets using a hammer mill into smaller particles with at least two different particle sizes that have a rough surface to enhance absorption by increasing the amount of the surface area available to absorb animal urine. Milling of the extruded pellets is done prior to drying them to minimize creation of dust. After milling, the '206 patent further teaches drying the extruded particles using heated air having a temperature of greater than 100 degrees Celsius until moisture content is reduced to between about 2% and about 10% by weight.\n\nUnfortunately, even where post-extrusion milling of the extruded pellets is not performed, drying the pellets using heated air having a temperature greater than 100 degrees Celsius relatively rapidly retrogrades starch in the pellets reducing urine absorption capacity. Where hammer milling is performed before drying while the pellets are still moist to minimize dusting, post-extrusion hammer milling of the pellets not only physically modifies starch in a manner that reduces absorption, but hammer milling also simultaneously heats up the pellets thermally modifying starch in a manner causing absorption-reducing retrogradation. Absorption is even further reduced during hot air drying after hammer milling because of additional starch retrogradation taking place. The result is that post-extrusion processing performed in carrying out the litter making method disclosed in the '206 patent intended to enhance absorption actually has the unintended opposite effect of undesirably reducing absorption. The same is true with respect to any alleged or purported ability of litter of the '206 patent to form lumps when wetted.\n\nThe '758 publication discloses a somewhat similar litter making method where whole cereal grains are ground before being extruded into spheres which are then cooled using a cooler before being ground up using a roll mill to form an absorbing material purportedly suitable for use as animal litter. Though the spheres are cooled after extrusion before grinding them into absorbing material composed of smaller size particles using a roll mill, the relatively high moisture content of the spheres can lead to post-extrusion retrogradation of starch in the spheres which in turn can adversely impact the absorbing material formed of the ground spheres by reducing absorption and preventing clumping. Despite the spheres being cooled prior to grinding them into absorbing material, the roll mill nonetheless further adversely impacts absorption and clumping properties of the resultant absorbing material by both physically and thermally modifying and retrograding starches in the spheres being ground.\n\nThe '977 publication is directed to animal litter extruded from a mixture of starch-containing cereal grain and at least 10% clay producing extruded litter particles having clay throughout that fills in pores in the outer surface of the litter particles producing an outer film of clay and starch that prevents dust from forming. Despite the extruded litter particles containing at least 10% clay, the '977 publication teaches coating them with one or more swelling clays is what imparts a clumping property to the litter particles that enables them to clump when wetted. While the clay and starch film on the outer surface of the extruded litter particles is taught in the '977 publication as beneficial for preventing dust formation, a related counterpart, U.S. Pat. No. 8,733,287, acknowledges the film is undesirable because it decreases the absorption rate of the extruded litter particles and teaches the necessity of grinding the litter particles with a roller-equipped litter fragmenting device in order to fragment them in order to remove the film to increase absorption by exposing the interior of the litter particles.\n\nU.S. Pat. Nos. 9,266,088, 9,266,089, 9,266,090 and 9,491,926 are each directed to an improved extruded granular absorbent well suited for use as litter and improved methods of making extruded granular absorbent where an admixture composed starch-containing material, preferably in the form of one or more cereal grains, is extruded from an extruder under conditions that modify at least some of the starch in the admixture forming a water soluble carbohydrate polymer binder that functions as a clumping agent to self-clump together pellets of the extruded granular absorbent. While the extruded granular absorbent to which these patents are directed has enjoyed substantial commercial success, improvements nonetheless remain desirable.\n\nIn this regard, it has been learned that moisture volatilized from pellets of the granular absorbent as the pellets are extruded from the extruder die and condenses on the outer surface of the extruded pellets detrimentally impacting one or more characteristics or properties of the extruded granular absorbent pellets adversely effecting granular absorbent performance, including when used as litter. It has been further learned that the condensed moisture adversely impacts pellet performance by undesirably affecting the state, structure, phase, or matrix of the starches in the extruded pellets in a manner that can cause the freshly extruded wet pellets to undesirably stick together right out of the extruder, can detrimentally reduce pellet absorption capacity, can undesirably increase bulk density, and can adversely impact the ability of the pellets to clump together when wetted with water or urine. It also has been learned that the excessive heat at which the pellets are extruded from the extruder die also can detrimentally affect the state, structure, phase, or matrix of the starches in the extruded pellets in a manner that also can adversely impact one or more such characteristics or properties of the pellets reducing their performance and effectiveness as a granular absorbent, particularly in litter applications. Finally, where any post-extrusion processing of the extruded granular absorbent is performed that involves physical contact, e.g., impact(s), mechanical engagement, e.g., crushing and/or compression, or other physical or thermal modification of the extruded pellets, such as what typically has occurred in the past when particle-size reduction has been performed on extruded pellets, it has been learned that such post-extrusion extruded granular absorbent processing carried out in performing such particle-size reduction can also adversely affect one or more of such properties or characteristics of the pellets even further detrimentally reducing their performance.\n\nWhile there have been numerous attempts to produce a granular absorbent suitable for use as cat, animal or pet litter that is more natural and lighter in weight than conventional clay or silica-gel litter that also clumps when wetted by water, urine or moist fecal matter, commercial success has been difficult to achieve. It has proven a rather formidable challenge to produce such a lighter weight clay and silica-gel litter alternative that performs well enough for consumers to readily substitute in place of conventional clay and silica-gel litters.\n\nWhile the marketplace abounds with many of so-called natural clay and silica-gel litter alternatives, very few pick up water and urine well and even fewer clump when wetted by water, urine or moist fecal matter. Types of natural litters presently on the market include litters composed of pine, recycled paper, corn cobs, corn, wheat, walnut shells and the like which typically have been ground up or otherwise comminuted into a desired reduced-size granular material having a consistency more suitable for litter usage.\n\nWhile the more environmentally friendly makeup of such natural litters appeals to an ever-increasing number of present-day consumers, these natural litters must still perform well enough in comparison to conventional clay and silica-gel litters for consumers to keep purchasing and using them. During use, such natural litters often either do not absorb urine well or rapidly enough to prevent some urine from pooling on the bottom of the litter box which not only generates odors over time but which also is messy undesirably requiring more frequent litter box clean up than desired. Where such natural litters purport to be clumping, their clumps tend to lack good cohesion producing clumps that are crumbly possessing unacceptably poor clump retention making them difficult to scoop out without breaking apart and leaving spent or soiled litter behind in the litter box. To improve upon these and other deficiencies common to such so-called natural litters, chemical treatments are applied and/or chemical additives blended to improve absorption and/or facilitate clumping. Unfortunately, doing so not only makes it harder to market such litter as ânaturalâ but it also can adversely impact its ability to biodegrade.\n\nIn other instances, lighter, lower costs filler materials can be blended not only with such natural litters but often are blended with conventional clay-based and silica-gel litters to make them lighter by reducing their bulk density as well as to reduce cost. Unfortunately, such lighter weight cost reducing fillers are typically viewed as diluents because they almost always adversely impact litter performance as a result of reducing or diluting the concentration of the useful or effective litter particles. Such fillers or diluents can and typically do reduce the clumping ability of clay-containing or clay-based clumping litters and quite often also reduce the overall capacity of the litter to absorb water, urine and liquefied fecal matter.\n\nWhat is needed is a system and method for making extruded granular absorbent that reduces and preferably minimizes such adverse moisture, temperature and mechanically induced changes to starch in extruded granular absorbent pellets following extrusion.\n\n\nSUMMARY OF THE INVENTION\n\n\nThe present invention is directed to an optimized system and method for making extruded granular absorbent and more particularly to a system and method of making extruded granular absorbent under relatively high extrusion pressures producing more repeatably consistent absorbent extrudate.\n\nThe present invention also is directed to a system and method for making extruded granular absorbent with much higher filler content, and more particular directed to an extruded granular absorbent system and method well suited for use in producing an extruded granular absorbent blend which has a relatively high inert or cellulose content.\n\nThe present invention also is directed toward a natural and biodegradable self-clumping granular absorbent litter whose activity is derived completely through the controlled extrusion of starch based materials, and whose activity can also significantly enhance the clumping properties of other non-clumping, low cost, natural and biodegradable litter material diluents, such as corn cob granules, paper pellets, or other cellulose derivatives without other additives.\n\nThe present invention is further directed toward the production of a natural and biodegradable self-clumping litter product that is derived from a natural starch source, such as preferably a cereal grain source, and which includes inert diluents such as corn cob granules, glass balls, glass pellets, glass beads, glass particles, plastic balls, plastic beads, plastic pellets, plastic pieces, minerals, paper granules, paper pellets, paper particles, other cellulose-containing or other cellulosic granules, pellets, balls, particles without requiring other adhesive or binder additives other than what is produced by physical and/or thermal modification of starches in an extruder during extrusion.\n\nVarious other features, advantages, and objects of the present invention will be made apparent from the following detailed description and any appended drawings.\n",

Said XML copy, created on May 24, 2023, is named 085342-3701_SL.xml and is 15,451 bytes.\n\n\nBACKGROUND\n\n\nMelons are annual, herbaceous, flowering plant species which were domesticated early and have been cultivated for thousands of years in African and Asian countries. They are presently cultivated worldwide and provide delicious and highly nutritious fruits. Melons are typically consumed fresh, in salads or prepared into desserts, appetizers, or drinks, for which they can be combined with a variety of other ingredients.\n\nMelon plants of the species \n\nMelon is a diploid plant species with twelve pairs of chromosomes. Melon plants of the species \n\nMelon production is most successful in a climate with a long warm sunny season that is relatively dry. Melons are grown throughout the world. Cultivation is both in open field as well as under protected circumstances (e.g. greenhouses). Since basically all cultivated melon belong to the ssp. \n\nSeveral pests and diseases can affect melon production, including several viruses, bacterial and fungal diseases. Typical diseases caused by viral infection include infection by Melon Necrotic Spot Virus (MNSV), Watermelon Mosaic Virus (WMV), and Cucurbit Yellow Stunting Disorder Virus (CYSDV). Typical diseases caused by fungal infection include downy mildew, powdery mildew, and gummy stem blight.\n\nOf the above-mentioned diseases powdery mildew (hereinafter also referred to as âPMâ) is one of the main fungal diseases in \n\nPowdery mildew can easily been identified as the symptoms of the fungal infection are quite distinctive. Plants that are infected display white powdery spots on the leaves and stems. In particular the lower leaves are affected, but the mildew may appear on any part of the plant that is exposed above ground. As the disease progresses the powdery spots increase in size and get thicker as massive numbers of spores form. In time the mildew spreads over the plant and may infect the stem and even the fruits. Severely affected plant parts, in particular the leaves, can become dry and brittle, or can wither and die. As a consequence of the fungal infection the melon fruits are frequently observed to be smaller in size, fewer in number, less able to be stored, sun scalded, incompletely ripe, and to have poor flavor. It has also been suggested that powdery mildew may predispose plants to be more vulnerable to other pathogens. Eventually, the plant can die.\n\nPowdery mildew develops quickly under favorable conditions because the length of time between infection and symptom appearance is usually only 3 to 7 days and a large number of conidia (asexual spore) can be produced in a short time. Favorable conditions include dense plant growth and low light intensity. High relative humidity is favorable for infection and conidial survival whereas dryness is favorable for colonization, sporulation, and dispersal. Powdery mildew development is arrested when daytime temperatures are at least 38 degrees Celsius.\n\nFungicide treatments may be used to prevent (further) development of powdery mildew on melon. For example, sulfur is a treatment that has been used for hundreds of years. However, in order to obtain adequate control, fungicide is needed on the undersurface of leaves and on leaves low in the plant canopy because the fungus develops best on these surfaces and weekly spraying programs are typically required. Development of fungicide resistance and consequent control failure is always a concern with mobile fungicides. Indeed strains of the powdery mildew fungus resistant (insensitive) to such fungicides have been found.\n\nPowdery mildew diseases are generally caused by different species of ascomycete fungi of the order Erysiphales. Two causal agents of powdery mildew on melon have been identified: \n\nPlants of the species \n\nAs already discussed above, fungicide treatments to control powdery mildew is rather complex and negatively affect the environment and may cause the development of powdery mildew fungus resistant (insensitive) to such fungicides. Therefor, and considering the economic importance of \n\nIn view of the above need in the art, it is an object of the present invention, amongst other objects, to meet this need. Accordingly, the technical problem underlying the present invention can been seen in the provision of such products, compositions, methods and uses for complying with any of the aforementioned needs. The technical problem is solved by the embodiments characterized in the claims and herein below.\n\nDescription\n",

    "description": "\n\nFIELD OF INVENTION\n\n\nThe present invention relates generally to a detection system.\n\n\nBACKGROUND\n\n\nThe monitoring of wildlife is utilized for varies purposes. For example, the environmental permits issued for the Alta I, II, III, IV, V, X, and XI wind farms require monitoring of California condor activity over a specified coverage area. The monitoring is intended to curtail turbines in time to avoid the risk of a condor striking a moving turbine blade. The preliminary design of such a system has been completed, including hardware requirements, system operation concepts, a cost estimate, and a development schedule.\n\nCurrent monitoring systems are described in: Alta Windpower Development. (2014). \n\n\nSUMMARY\n\n\nThe present disclosure includes a condor monitoring system that will provide data on the presence and location of condors in the Southern California flock that have GPS or VHF tracking tags.\n\nActive transmitter tags are used to track the location of moving objects in real time. The tags are affixed to the object(s) of interest and send out a signal that interacts with receiving systems in a manner that allows estimation of the tag's location and/or trajectory. Two types of tags are considered in the invention: receiver-located tags and self-located tags.\n\nReceiver-located tags emit a signal that is detected by a receiver station. The receiver station uses signal characteristics to estimate the presence, location, and/or trajectory of the tag. An example of receiver-located tags includes, but is not limited to, VHF transmitter tags attached to animals to track their location. The use of receiver-located tags can, but need not, involve the use of received signal strength. Signal strength is correlated with the distance between the tag and the receiver; weak signals indicate a large distance and strong signals indicate a short distance. Several embodiments of the invention relate to improving how signal strength can be used to estimate the distance between a receiver-located tag and a receiver.\n\nSelf-located tags determine their location themselves, and then transmit that location to a receiver station. An example of self-located tags includes, but is not limited to, GPS tags attached to animals to track their location. Self-located tags can, but need not, transmit their locations via cellular modem. GPS tags are an example of self-located tags, and Very High Frequency (VHF) tags are an example of receiver-located tags. Throughout this document, the term âVHF tagâ refers to any type of receiver-located tag, and the term âGPS tagâ refers to any type of self-located tag.\n\nThe usefulness of active transmitter tags is dependent on the precision and accuracy of position and/or trajectory estimates calculated by receiving system. The claims presented in this document are methods to improve the precision and/or accuracy of transmitter tag location and/or trajectory estimates.\n\nCondor presence and location data will be presented to members of a condor initial response team (CIRT). The CIRT is responsible for locating any detected condors (visually or via handheld VHF receivers) if possible. They are also responsible for issuing curtailment commands to turbines as needed to avoid an impact between turbine blades and condors. The criteria upon which the preliminary design is based (including details on curtailment requirements) are compiled in the following document: Basis of Design for a Condor Monitoring System Rev 4 dated September 2\n\nThe condor monitoring system includes three subsystems: (1) The VHF system; (2) The GPS system; and (3) The unified alerting and monitoring system (UAMS). The VHF system detects condors that carry VHF tags. The GPS system detects condors that carry GPS tags. The UAMS compiles the position data from the other two systems and initiates response protocols.\n\nThis document serves to describe the system design and operation based on an initial review of the system requirements, hardware that is commercially available, and conceptual system operation algorithms.\n\nThe invention includes methods to improve estimates of the position and/or trajectory of active transmitter tags: including estimation of signal degradation based on Fresnel zone analysis of site topography to inform estimation of the distance between a receiver system and a receiver-located tag; supplementation of signal degradation calculations with the results of system mapping; use of fixed sentinel signals to monitor the magnitude of signal degradation due to variable environmental factors, one example of which is weather; refinement of position estimates by accounting for the absence of signal detection (location by exclusion). For tags attached to moving entities, calculation of a time-to-boundary (TTB) parameter. The TTB is an estimate of the minimum amount of time required for the animal to reach a point of interest. Integration of position estimates from one type of tag based on estimates from the other type of tag, when both are attached to the same entity, to improve the precision and/or accuracy of position and/or trajectory estimates calculated from the less precise and/or accurate tag.\n\nThe term âsubstantiallyâ is defined as largely but not necessarily wholly what is specifiedâand includes what is specified; e.g., substantially 90 degrees includes 90 degrees and substantially parallel includes parallelâas understood by a person of ordinary skill in the art. In any disclosed embodiment, the terms âsubstantiallyâ and âaboutâ may be substituted with âwithin [a percentage] ofâ what is specified, where the percentage includes 0.1, 1, 5, and 10 percent.\n",

    "description": "\n\nBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n\n1. Field of the Invention\n\n\nIn general, the present invention relates to confinement structures for pets. More particularly, the present invention relates to confinement structures for pets that are designed to float on water.\n\n\n2. Prior Art Description\n\n\nMany people enjoy performing day to day activities in the company of their pets. Many pets are trained to follow their owners or do so by instinct. One area where a pet will often not follow an owner is into a body of water, such as a pool or lake. This is especially true of pets, such as cats, that have a natural aversion to water. As a result, if a pet owner wants to swim, the pet owner must leave their pet tied on a leash or confined in the home, car or other enclosed space. This separation can cause anxiety in both the pet and the owner of the pet. As will be explained, the present invention is directed toward designs that enables a pet owner to bring their pet into a calm body of water, such as a pool or a lake, in a manner that is safe and inviting to the pet.\n\nIn addition, on occasions, pets may have to be transported over water. For instance, during a sudden flood, a person may have to transport their pet over water to higher ground. Often, pets must be abandoned during emergencies. The pets then must be rescued by emergency personnel. A rescue worker cannot always carry a pet through water. Rather, the rescue worker needs a floating cage to confine and transport a pet safely across open water.\n\nIn the prior art, pet confinement cages have been designed for use by rescue workers. Such prior art is exemplified by U.S. Pat. No. 8,662,020 to Tecco and U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 2011/0079971 to Lulevitch. Such prior art devices are large and bulky to prevent capsizing. This is necessary because if the floating cage were to capsize, the pets within the floating cage could quickly drown.\n\nThe large size, heavy construction, and corresponding high cost of floating pet rescue cages make such products unappealing to ordinary pet owners. Furthermore, the prior art floating pet rescue cages are typically sized for medium to large dogs. Accordingly, the prior art floating cages have a significant volume below the waterline. In order for the prior art floating cage to be stable in the water, a significant ballast weight must be added to the floating cag to stabilize the floating cage. Accordingly, prior art floating cages may be useful for average to large sized dogs but can float too high in the water and unstable if only a small dog or cat is placed in the floating cage.\n\nA need therefore exists for a lightweight, inexpensive confinement for a pet that is designed to float in a stable manner, regardless to the size and weight of the confined pet. Furthermore, a need exists for a floating confinement system that is lightweight and has a corresponding low displacement in water. A need also exists for a floating pet confinement that automatically releases the pet, should the pet confinement capsize in a body of water. In this manner a pet owner can conveniently and safely bring their pet with them when lounging in a pool or otherwise swimming in water. These needs are met by the present invention as described and claimed below.\n\n\nSUMMARY OF THE INVENTION\n\n\nThe present invention is a floating pet confinement system that enables a pet to safely float on water while remaining dry and confined. The system has a buoyant base that can be inflatable or molded from a highly buoyant material, such as styrene foam. The buoyant base has a first area, a top surface, and a center of gravity.\n\nA plurality of holes is formed in the top surface of the buoyant base. A pet enclosure is set atop the top surface of the buoyant base. The pet enclosure has an open bottom through which a pet can easily pass. When set on the buoyant base, the open bottom is obstructed by the underlying buoyant base. The pet enclosure engages the holes on the buoyant base when the pet enclosure is upright. However, the pet enclosure is free to disengage from the holes and fall away from the buoyant base should the buoyant base tip due to storm action, a passing boat wake and/or horseplay.\n\nA pet is placed within the enclosure atop the buoyant base. The overall system, with the pet, can then be placed in a pool or another body of water. Should the buoyant base tilt past a certain angle of inclination, the pet enclosure will fall away from the buoyant base.

    "description": "\n\nBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n\nField of the Invention\n\n\nThe present invention relates generally to the field of corn breeding. In particular, the invention relates to corn seed and plants of the hybrid variety designated CH010980, and derivatives and tissue cultures thereof.\n\n\nDescription of Related Art\n\n\nThe goal of field crop breeding is to combine various desirable traits in a single variety/hybrid. Such desirable traits include greater yield, better stalks, better roots, resistance to insecticides, herbicides, pests, and disease, tolerance to heat and drought, reduced time to crop maturity, better agronomic quality, higher nutritional value, and uniformity in germination times, stand establishment, growth rate, maturity, and fruit size.\n\nPlant breeding techniques take advantage of how a plant is naturally pollinated. There are two general methods of pollination. A plant is self-pollinated when pollen from one flower is transferred to the same flower or another flower of the same plant. A plant is cross-pollinated when pollen comes to it from a flower of a different plant.\n\nCorn plants (\n\nPlants that have been self-pollinated and selected for type over many generations become homozygous at almost all gene loci and produce a uniform population of true breeding progeny, i.e., a homozygous plant. A cross between two such homozygous plants produces a uniform population of hybrid plants that are heterozygous for many gene loci and phenotypically uniform.\n\nThe development of uniform corn plant hybrids requires developing homozygous inbred plants, crossing these inbred plants, and evaluating these crosses. Pedigree breeding and recurrent selection are examples of breeding methods used to develop hybrid parent plants from breeding populations. Those breeding methods combine the genetic backgrounds from two or more inbred plants or various other broad-based sources into breeding pools from which new inbred plants are developed by selfing combined with phenotypic or genotypic selection. The new inbred plants are crossed with other inbred plants and the hybrids produced by these crosses are evaluated for commercial potential.\n\nNorth American farmers plant tens of millions of acres of corn at the present time and there are extensive national and international commercial corn breeding programs. A continuing goal of these corn breeding programs is to develop corn hybrids that are based on stable inbred plants and have one or more desirable characteristics. To accomplish this goal, the corn breeder must select and develop superior inbred parental plants.\n\n\nSUMMARY OF THE INVENTION\n\n\nIn one aspect, the present invention provides a corn plant of the hybrid variety designated CH010980. Also provided are corn plants having all the physiological and morphological characteristics of the hybrid corn variety CH010980. A hybrid corn plant of the invention may further comprise a cytoplasmic or nuclear factor that is capable of conferring male sterility or otherwise preventing self-pollination, such as by self-incompatibility. Parts of the corn plant of the present invention are also provided, for example, pollen obtained from a hybrid plant and an ovule of the hybrid plant. The invention also concerns seed of the hybrid corn variety CH010980. The hybrid corn seed of the invention may be provided as a population of corn seed of the variety designated CH010980.\n\nIn a further aspect, the invention provides a composition comprising a seed of corn variety CH010980 comprised in plant seed growth media. In certain embodiments, the plant seed growth media is a soil or synthetic cultivation medium. In specific embodiments, the growth medium may be comprised in a container or may, for example, be soil in a field.\n\nIn another aspect of the invention, the hybrid corn variety CH010980 comprising an added heritable trait or genetic modification is provided. The heritable trait may comprise a genetic locus that comprises a dominant or recessive allele. In certain embodiments of the invention, the genetic locus confers traits such as, for example, male sterility, waxy starch, herbicide resistance, insect resistance, resistance to bacterial, fungal, nematode or viral disease, and altered fatty acid, phytate or carbohydrate metabolism. In certain embodiments, the genetic locus that confers herbicide resistance may confer resistance to herbicides such as, for example, imidazolinone herbicides, sulfonylurea herbicides, triazine herbicides, phenoxy herbicides, cyclohexanedione herbicides, benzonitrile herbicides, 4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate dioxygenase-inhibiting herbicides, protoporphyrinogen oxidase-inhibiting herbicides, acetolactate synthase-inhibiting herbicides, 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid synthase-inhibiting herbicides, bromoxynil, nicosulfuron, 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D), dicamba, quizalofop-p-ethyl, glyphosate, or glufosinate. The genetic locus may be a naturally occurring corn gene introduced into the genome of a parent of the variety by backcrossing, a natural or induced mutation, or a transgene introduced through genetic transformation techniques. When introduced through transformation, a genetic locus may comprise one or more transgenes integrated at a single chromosomal location.\n\nIn further embodiments, a single locus conversion of one or both of the parental varieties of the hybrid corn variety CH010980 comprises a heritable genetic modification to the genome of one or both of the parental varieties. A heritable genetic modification may comprise, for example, an insertion, deletion, or substitution of a nucleotide sequence. In certain embodiments, a single locus may comprise one or more genes or intergenic regions integrated into or mutated at a single locus or may comprise one or more nucleic acid molecules integrated at the single locus. In particular embodiments, a single locus conversion may be generated by genome editing such as through use of engineered nucleases, as is known in the art. Examples of engineered nucleases include, but are not limited to, Cas endonucleases, zinc finger nucleases (ZFNs), transcription activator-like effector nucleases (TALENs), and engineered meganucleases, also known as homing endonucleases. Naturally occurring nucleases can also find use for genome editing. In specific embodiments, endonucleases, both naturally occurring and engineered, may utilize any polypeptide-, DNA-, or RNA-guided genome editing systems known to the skilled artisan.\n\nIn yet another aspect of the invention, a hybrid corn plant of the variety designated CH010980 is provided, wherein a cytoplasmically-inherited trait has been introduced into said hybrid plant. Such cytoplasmically-inherited traits are passed to progeny through the female parent in a particular cross. An exemplary cytoplasmically-inherited trait is the male sterility trait. Cytoplasmic-male sterility (CMS) is a pollen abortion phenomenon determined by the interaction between the genes in the cytoplasm and the nucleus. Alteration in the mitochondrial genome and the lack of restorer genes in the nucleus will lead to pollen abortion. With either a normal cytoplasm or the presence of restorer gene(s) in the nucleus, the plant will produce pollen normally. A CMS plant can be pollinated by a maintainer version of the same variety, which has a normal cytoplasm but lacks the restorer gene(s) in the nucleus, and continues to be male sterile in the next generation. The male fertility of a CMS plant can be restored by a restorer version of the same variety, which must have the restorer gene(s) in the nucleus. With the restorer gene(s) in the nucleus, the offspring of the male-sterile plant can produce normal pollen grains and propagate. A cytoplasmically inherited trait may be a naturally occurring maize trait or a trait introduced through genetic transformation techniques.\n\nIn another aspect of the invention, a tissue culture of regenerable cells of a plant of variety CH010980 is provided. The tissue culture will preferably be capable of regenerating plants capable of expressing all of the physiological and morphological characteristics of the variety, and of regenerating plants having substantially the same genotype as other plants of the variety. Examples of some of the physiological and morphological characteristics of the variety CH010980 include characteristics related to yield, maturity, and kernel quality, each of which is specifically disclosed herein. The regenerable cells in such tissue cultures may, for example, be derived from embryos, meristematic cells, immature tassels, microspores, pollen, leaves, anthers, roots, root tips, silk, flowers, kernels, ears, cobs, husks, or stalks, or from callus or protoplasts derived from those tissues. Still further, the present invention provides corn plants regenerated from the tissue cultures of the invention, the plants having all the physiological and morphological characteristics of variety CH010980.\n\nIn still another aspect, the invention provides a method of producing hybrid corn seed comprising crossing a plant of variety CV681190 with a plant of variety CV399175. In a cross, either parent may serve as the male or female. Processes are also provided for producing corn seeds or plants in which the processes generally comprise crossing a first parent corn plant with a second parent corn plant, wherein at least one of the first or second parent corn plants is a plant of the variety designated CH010980. In such crossing, either parent may serve as the male or female parent. These processes may be further exemplified as processes for preparing hybrid corn seed or plants, wherein a first hybrid corn plant is crossed with a second corn plant of a different, distinct variety to provide a hybrid that has, as one of its parents, the hybrid corn plant variety CH010980. In these processes, crossing will result in the production of seed. The seed production occurs regardless of whether the seed is collected or not.\n\nIn one embodiment of the invention, the first step in âcrossingâ comprises planting, often in pollinating proximity, seeds of a first and second parent corn plant, and in many cases, seeds of a first corn plant and a second, distinct corn plant. When the plants are not in pollinating proximity, pollination can nevertheless be accomplished by transferring a pollen or tassel bag from one plant to the other as described below.\n\nA second step comprises cultivating or growing the seeds of said first and second parent corn plants into plants that bear flowers (corn bears both male flowers (tassels) and female flowers (silks) in separate anatomical structures on the same plant). A third step comprises preventing self-pollination of the plants, i.e., preventing the silks of a plant from being fertilized by any plant of the same variety, including the same plant. This can be done, for example, by emasculating the male flowers of the first or second parent corn plant, (i.e., treating or manipulating the flowers so as to prevent pollen production, in order to produce an emasculated parent corn plant). Self-incompatibility systems may also be used in some hybrid crops for the same purpose. Self-incompatible plants still shed viable pollen and can pollinate plants of other varieties but are incapable of pollinating themselves or other plants of the same variety.\n\nA fourth step may comprise allowing cross-pollination to occur between the first and second parent corn plants. When the plants are not in pollinating proximity, this is done by placing a bag, usually paper or glassine, over the tassels of the first plant and another bag over the silks of the incipient ear on the second plant. The bags are left in place for at least 24 hours. Since pollen is viable for less than 24 hours, this assures that the silks are not pollinated from other pollen sources, that any stray pollen on the tassels of the first plant is no longer viable, and that the only pollen transferred comes from the first plant. The pollen bag over the tassel of the first plant is then shaken vigorously to enhance release of pollen from the tassels, and the shoot bag is removed from the silks of the incipient ear on the second plant. Finally, the pollen bag is removed from the tassel of the first plant and is placed over the silks of the incipient ear of the second plant, shaken again and left in place. Yet another step comprises harvesting the seeds from at least one of the parent corn plants. The harvested seed can be grown to produce a corn plant or hybrid corn plant.\n\nThe present invention also provides corn seed and plants produced by a process that comprises crossing a first parent corn plant with a second parent corn plant, wherein at least one of the first or second parent corn plants is a plant of the variety designated CH010980. In one embodiment of the invention, corn seed and plants produced by the process are first generation hybrid corn seed and plants produced by crossing an inbred with another, distinct inbred. The present invention further contemplates seed of an F\n\nSuch a plant can be analyzed by its âgenetic complement.â This term is used to refer to the aggregate of nucleotide sequences, the expression of which defines the phenotype of, for example, a corn plant, or a cell or tissue of that plant. A genetic complement thus represents the genetic makeup of a cell, tissue or plant. The invention thus provides corn plant cells that have a genetic complement in accordance with the corn plant cells disclosed herein, and plants, seeds and diploid plants containing such cells.\n\nPlant genetic complements may be assessed by genetic marker profiles, and by the expression of phenotypic traits that are characteristic of the expression of the genetic complement, e.g., marker typing profiles. It is known in the art that such complements may also be identified by marker types including, but not limited to, Simple Sequence Repeats (SSRs), Simple Sequence Length Polymorphisms (SSLPs) (Williams et al., \n\nIn still yet another aspect, the present invention provides hybrid genetic complements, as represented by corn plant cells, tissues, plants, and seeds, formed by the combination of a haploid genetic complement of a corn plant of the invention with a haploid genetic complement of the same or a different variety. In another aspect, the present invention provides a corn plant regenerated from a tissue culture that comprises a hybrid genetic complement of this invention.\n",

    "description": "\n\nBACKGROUND\n\n\nAn animal, such as a pet, is typically unable to communicate to a pet owner or veterinarian the activities performed by the animal. Such activities may include the movements of the animal, the feedings of the animal, the play of the animal, and the waste activities of the animal. Movements of the animal, feedings of the animal, and waste activities of the animal can be manually observed via a pet owner or veterinarian. Such manual observation of the animal can be useful in determining if the animal is eating the desired amount of calories and/or urinating/defecating a desired amount of times, for example. Manual approaches, however, are often cumbersome and do not provide timely diagnosis of the animal's caloric intake and expenditures. Further, manual observation of animals is prone to inaccuracies, incompleteness, and forgetfulness. Thus, what is desired is a method and/or system for automatically determining the eating, drinking, playing, urinating, and defecating behavior of the animal, for example, during a predetermined time period. Such determinations may be used to easily and accurately determine the health (such as gastro-intestinal health) of the animal.\n\n\nBRIEF SUMMARY\n\n\nA system, apparatus, and/or method of identifying an activity of an animal. The activity may include the animal drinking, eating, urination, or defecating. Motion data of a first animal may be received, for example, via a sensor. Predetermined signatures of one or more second animals may be received. The predetermined signatures of the one or more second animals may be associated with one or more activities of the one or more second animals. A signature of an activity of the first animal may be determined based on the motion data of the first animal. Based on the signature of the activity of the first animal and the predetermined signatures of the second animal, the activity of the first animal may be identified. The identified activity of the first animal may be displayed via a display device.\n",

    "abstract": "The development is a pet grooming loop that includes a hook and at least one slide.

The slide has an easy latch mechanism so that it can be closed and opened with one hand.\n\n",
    "description": "\n\nGOVERNMENT INTEREST\n\n\nThe invention was made without government support.\n\n\nFIELD OF THE INVENTION\n\n\nThe invention relates generally to the field of pet restraint devices.\n\n\nBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION\n\n\nIn order to maintain control over a pet, such as a dog or cat, during the grooming process, it is common to use secure the pet with a grooming loop. A grooming loop differs from a common leash by including a loop at one end that is secured around the pet being groomed and a hook at an opposing end to allow a groomer to secure the grooming loop and pet to a grooming table or similar work station. In addition, the grooming loop may include one or more slides to allow the groomer to adjust the size of the loop to better fit the pet being groomed.\n\nFor the safety of the pet, it is common for the groomer to have one hand on the pet at essentially all times. The groomer then uses his or her free hand to secure or release the hook and to adjust the slides. However, most hooks and slides require two hands for operation, thereby requiring the groomer to risk the safety of the pet while securing or releasing the hook or when adjusting the slide. Thus, a grooming loop with a single-hand hook operation would be beneficial to groomers. In addition, it would be beneficial if the grooming loop included a cam lock and/or a slider that were adjustable using a single hand.\n\n\nSUMMARY OF THE PRESENT INVENTION\n\n\nThe present development is a pet grooming loop, such as used for restraining dogs or cats during grooming, having a bolt snap designed to allow for single-handed control. The grooming loop with the bolt snap comprises a strap, a bolt snap, at least one cam lock and at least one slider. The single-handed control bolt snap allows the user to open the bolt snap with one hand while leaving a second hand free. In a preferred embodiment, the bolt snap is secured onto the loop by a locking pin unit that allows the loop material to slip within an eye of the bolt snap. The eye can be opened so that different types of loop materials may be used. The cam lock has an easy latch so that it can be closed and opened with one hand. The slider includes at least one nub to allow the slide to be easily moved with one hand, even when the hand is wet or slippery.\n",

    "description": "\n\nBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION\n\n\nThe present invention relates to a new and distinctive soybean cultivar, designated 04230926. All publications cited in this application are herein incorporated by reference. There are numerous steps in the development of any novel, desirable plant germplasm. Plant breeding begins with the analysis and definition of problems and weaknesses of the current germplasm, the establishment of program goals, and the definition of specific breeding objectives. The next step is selection of germplasm that possesses the traits to meet the program goals. The goal is to combine in a single cultivar an improved combination of desirable traits from the parental germplasm. These important traits may include, but are not limited to, higher seed yield, resistance to diseases and insects, better stems and roots, tolerance to drought and heat, altered fatty acid profile, abiotic stress tolerance, improvements in compositional traits, and better agronomic quality.\n\nThese processes, which lead to the final step of marketing and distribution, can take from six to twelve years from the time the first cross is made. Therefore, development of new cultivars is a time-consuming process that requires precise forward planning, efficient use of resources, and a minimum of changes in direction.\n\nSoybean (\n\nThe soybean is the world's leading source of vegetable oil and protein meal. The oil extracted from soybeans is used for cooking oil, margarine, and salad dressings. Soybean oil is composed of saturated, monounsaturated, and polyunsaturated fatty acids. It has a typical composition of 11% palmitic, 4% stearic, 25% oleic, 50% linoleic, and 9% linolenic fatty acid content (âEconomic Implications of Modified Soybean Traits Summary Report,â Iowa Soybean Promotion Board and American Soybean Association Special Report 92S (May 1990)). Changes in fatty acid composition for improved oxidative stability and nutrition are constantly sought after. Industrial uses of soybean oil, which is subjected to further processing, include ingredients for paints, plastics, fibers, detergents, cosmetics, lubricants, and biodiesel fuel. Soybean oil may be split, inter-esterified, sulfurized, epoxidized, polymerized, ethoxylated, or cleaved. Designing and producing soybean oil derivatives with improved functionality and improved oliochemistry is a rapidly growing field. The typical mixture of triglycerides is usually split and separated into pure fatty acids, which are then combined with petroleum-derived alcohols or acids, nitrogen, sulfonates, chlorine, or with fatty alcohols derived from fats and oils to produce the desired type of oil or fat.\n\nSoybeans are also used as a food source for both animals and humans. Soybeans are widely used as a source of protein for poultry, swine, and cattle feed. During processing of whole soybeans, the fibrous hull is removed and the oil is extracted. The remaining soybean meal is a combination of carbohydrates and approximately 50% protein.\n\nFor human consumption, soybean meal is made into soybean flour, which is processed to protein concentrates used for meat extenders or specialty pet foods. Production of edible protein ingredients from soybean offers a healthy, less expensive replacement for animal protein in meats, as well as dairy type products.\n\nThe foregoing examples of the related art and limitations related therewith are intended to be illustrative and not exclusive. Other limitations of the related art will become apparent to those of skill in the art upon a reading of the specification.\n\n\nSUMMARY OF THE INVENTION\n\n\nThe following embodiments and aspects thereof are described in conjunction with systems, tools and methods which are meant to be exemplary, not limiting in scope.

    "description": "\n\nBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n\nField of the Invention\n\n\nThe present disclosure relates to a fishing reel having a magnet disposed in a circumferential direction crossing the axial direction of a spool and, more particularly, to a fishing reel that can increase a braking force control range even without an increase in size and can maximize a casting distance by preventing backlash and preventing reduction of a casting distance due to a braking force by using a magnet brake.\n\n\nDescription of the Related Art\n\n\nIn general, when casting with a casting reel, the rotational speed of a spool from which a fishing line is released is larger than a flying speed of a lure, so the flying distance of the lure is short or the fishing line is entangled, which is called backlash.\n\nIn order to prevent such backlash, a fishing reel, in a broad meaning, employs a friction brake that uses physical friction and a magnet brake that uses attraction of magnetism.\n\nThe magnet brake of these brakes, which is a non-contact type brake unlike the friction brake, reduces the rotational speed of a spool by applying attraction of magnetism to the rotating spool using the magnetism of a plurality of magnet brakes disposed on a reel body.\n\nAccording to magnet brakes of the related art, a ring type plate is mounted on a side of a spool and a plurality of magnets is circularly arranged on a side spaced apart from the plate such that the magnets and the plate face each other, so when the spool is rotated at a high speed, the magnetism of the magnets acts on the plate and generates a braking force, thereby preventing backlash.\n\nSuch magnet brakes of the related art are configured to control the braking force by adjusting a gap by moving a holder, on which magnets are mounted, in the axial direction of a spool.\n\nHowever, since such magnet brakes of the related art are configured to adjust a fine gap between magnets and a plate disposed to face each other, the braking force control range is unavoidably small, and accordingly, when the movement distance of a holder is increased to increase the braking force control range, there is a problem that the body of a fishing reel is correspondingly increased in size.\n\nFurther, since the braking force of magnet brakes of the related art is fixed regardless of the rotation speed of a spool, a braking force over a predetermined level keeps being generated even though a spool is rotated at a low speed, so there is a problem that a casting distance decreases, etc.\n\nFor reference, as relevant technologies in the related art, there are Korean Patent Application Publication No. 10-2015-0006698, Korean Utility Model No. 20-0144800, Korean Patent Application Publication No. 10-2012-0112132, Korean Patent Application Publication No. 10-2012-0133584, etc.\n\n\nSUMMARY OF THE INVENTION\n\n\nThe present disclosure has been made in an effort to solve the problems described above and an objective of the present disclosure is to provide a fishing reel that can increase a braking force control range even without an increase in size and can maximize a casting distance by preventing backlash and preventing reduction of a casting distance due to a braking force by using a magnet brake. In order to achieve the objectives of the present disclosure, a fishing reel according to the present disclosure includes: a spool having a drum on which a fishing line is wound; and a magnet brake including a holder disposed on a side of the spool and a magnet mounted on the holder in a circumferential direction crossing an axial direction of the spool to have inner and outer facing surfaces and generating a braking force to the spool.\n\nFurther, in the fishing reel according to the present disclosure, the spool may include a facing part extending in the axial direction of the spool from an end of the drum to face one of the inner and outer facing surfaces of the magnet, and receiving magnetism of the magnet.\n\nFurther, in the fishing reel according to the present disclosure, the holder may be moved forward and backward in the axial direction of the spool, so a braking force may be controlled in accordance with variation of a facing area between the magnet and the facing part.\n\nFurther, in the fishing reel according to the present disclosure, the magnet may have an outer diameter smaller than an inner diameter of the facing part, so magnetism may act on an inner circumferential surface of the facing part.\n\nFurther, in the fishing reel according to the present disclosure, the holder may include a mount, in which the magnet is fitted, and a fixing plate detachably coupled to the holder while covering an opening of the mount and configured to fix the magnet.\n\nAccording to the fishing reel of the present disclosure, since the magnet that generates a braking force to the spool is mounted in a circumferential direction crossing an axial direction of the spool to have inner and outer facing surfaces, the magnet brake and the facing part of the spool can be disposed to overlap each other without being spaced apart from each other to the left and right, so the left-right movement distance of the magnet brake is maximally secured, and accordingly, it is possible to secure a braking force control range as wide as possible even without increasing the size of the fishing reel.\n\nIn particular, since a braking force is increased or decreased in accordance with the rotation speed of the spool with the braking force initially set, there is an effect that it is possible to effectively suppress backlash and prevent reduction of a casting distance.\n",

    "description": "\n\nFIELD AND BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION\n\n\nThe present invention, in some embodiments thereof, relates to sex sorting of mosquitoes and, more particularly, but not exclusively, to a method and apparatus for providing sorted male mosquitoes.\n\nTo date, mosquito SIT (Sterile Insect Technique) has proved itself in small scale projects around the globe, as a promising and effective tool for fighting mosquito-borne diseases. The idea is to release male mosquitoes with unique characteristics such that their off spring do not evolve, or the distributed males are sterile such that there will not be any offspring.\n\nSmall scale pilots, in which a few million male mosquitoes were released on small area, were performed by different research institutions and companies, all demonstrated reduction in mosquito population in that area weeks after deploying the engineered male mosquitoes on a weekly basis.\n\nIn order to treat large areas, millions of mosquitoes are needed to be produced on a daily basis.\n\nHowever, the operational costs associated with the labor intensive involved in the rearing and handling process today prevent the mosquito SIT from scaling up. The specific steps in the rearing process we are referring to are:\n\n\nThere is on-going research to optimize the sorting process. However, most systems to date, have tried to sort while in the pupa stage (based on weight, size, color). Other attempts have involved zapping the female mosquitoes while they are adults.\n\nA problem is that the adult mosquito can be very active, and thus from the moment you classified its sex until you manage to do something it may have moved or flown away.\n\nAlso having other mosquitoes in the field of view may obscure the vision sensor. Sorting at the pupa, may lead to large collateral damage (meaning many dead males).\n\n\nSUMMARY OF THE INVENTION\n\n\nThe present embodiments may use a time when adult mosquitoes are still, in order to apply imaging and then pick the wanted insects or zap the unwanted insects. Such a time may be the time when the insect emerges from the pupa, or when the insects are cooled down to a temperature at which they are still. In both cases the insects are still for a period of time which is long enough to be identified by the imaging process and then either picked up or zapped as the imaging process is able to guide a robot arm to find the insect.\n\nAccording to an aspect of some embodiments of the present invention there is provided a method for mechanical sex-sorting of mosquitoes by extracting a class of mosquitoes from unsorted mosquitoes, the method comprising:\n\n\nIn an embodiment, said classifying comprises using a trained neural network.\n\nIn an embodiment, said trained neural network comprises four or more layers.\n\nIn an embodiment, said obtaining images comprises obtaining successive frames, generating differences between said successive frames and using said differences to determine which individuals are in said stationary phase.\n\nIn an embodiment, said classifying comprises using a recurrent neural network (RNN).\n\nIn an embodiment, said unsorted insects are emerging pupae and said stationary phase is emergence.\n\nIn an embodiment, said unsorted insects are adults and said stationary phase is obtained by cooling said insects.\n\nThe method may comprise tracking movement of individual insects to update respective obtained coordinates prior to using said robot arm.\n\nThe method may comprise obtaining said images for classification using a first, relatively high resolution, camera, and carrying out said tracking using a second, relatively low resolution, camera.\n\nIn an embodiment, said obtained coordinates are of said male class and said identified individuals are picked off and placed in storage.\n\nIn an embodiment, said robot arm comprises a suction device or a blower device to pick off said identified individuals and place in storage.\n\nIn an embodiment, said obtained coordinates are of said female class and said identified individuals are destroyed.\n\nIn an embodiment, said robot arm comprises a zapper for destroying said identified individuals.\n\nIn an embodiment, said zapper is one member of the group comprising an electrode and a laser.\n\nIn an embodiment, if an individual is not classified into male or female by a predetermined time, then the image is sent to an operator.\n\nIn an embodiment, if an individual is not classified as male by a predetermined time then it is classified as female.\n\nIn an embodiment, said insects are cooled in a container having walls, so that the cooled insects stand on an interior side of said walls, the method comprising dismantling said box to present said interior sides of said walls for said obtaining said images.\n\nIn an embodiment, said insects are cooled in a container having a trap door and said trap door is opened onto a first moving conveyor, to allow said cooled insects to fall through, said first moving conveyor carrying said insects to an imaging location for said obtaining images, and said conveyor stopping with insects at said imaging location to obtain said coordinates.\n\nIn an embodiment, said first moving conveyor is a relatively fast moving conveyor, thereby to prevent piling of insects disrupting imaging, wherein said obtained coordinates are of the female class so that male insects are retained on the conveyor, the first moving conveyor emptying onto a second moving conveyor being a relatively slow moving conveyor, said relatively slow moving conveyor conveying said retained insects for placing in storage cartridges.\n\nAccording to a second aspect of the present invention there is provided apparatus for mechanical sex-sorting of mosquitoes by extracting a class of mosquitoes from unsorted mosquitoes, the apparatus comprising:\n\n\nUnless otherwise defined, all technical and/or scientific terms used herein have the same meaning as commonly understood by one of ordinary skill in the art to which the invention pertains. Although methods and materials similar or equivalent to those described herein can be used in the practice or testing of embodiments of the invention, exemplary methods and/or materials are described below. In case of conflict, the patent specification, including definitions, will control. In addition, the materials, methods, and examples are illustrative only and are not intended to be necessarily limiting.\n\nImplementation of the imaging and directing of the robot arms in embodiments of the invention can involve performing or completing selected tasks manually, automatically, or a combination thereof. Moreover, according to actual instrumentation and equipment of embodiments of the method and/or system of the invention, several selected tasks could be implemented by hardware, by software or by firmware or by a combination thereof using an operating system.\n\nFor example, hardware for performing selected tasks according to embodiments of the invention could be implemented as a chip or a circuit. As software, selected tasks according to embodiments of the invention could be implemented as a plurality of software instructions being executed by a computer using any suitable operating system. In an exemplary embodiment of the invention, one or more tasks according to exemplary embodiments of method and/or system as described herein are performed by a data processor, such as a computing platform for executing a plurality of instructions.

Modifications include human and/or humanized immunoglobulin loci. Mice that lack a functional endogenous ADAM6 gene but that comprise ADAM6 function are described, including mice that comprise an ectopic nucleic acid sequence that encodes an ADAM6 protein. Genetically modified male mice that comprise a modification of an endogenous immunoglobulin V\n\n\nBACKGROUND OF INVENTION\n\n\nMice that contain human antibody genes are known in the art. Pharmaceutical applications for antibodies in the last two decades have fueled a great deal of research into making antibodies that are suitable for use as human therapeutics. Early antibody therapeutics, which were based on mouse antibodies, were not ideal as human therapeutics because repeated administration of mouse antibodies to humans results in immunogenicity that can confound long-term treatment regimens. Solutions based on humanizing mouse antibodies to make them appear more human and less mouse-like were developed. Methods for expressing human immunoglobulin sequences for use in antibodies followed, mostly based on in vitro expression of human immunoglobulin libraries in phage, bacteria, or yeast. Finally, attempts were made to make useful human antibodies from human lymphocytes in vitro, in mice engrafted with human hematopoietic cells, and in transchromosomal or transgenic mice with disabled endogenous immunoglobulin loci. In the transgenic mice, it was necessary to disable the endogenous mouse immunoglobulin genes so that the randomly integrated fully human transgenes would function as the source of immunoglobulin sequences expressed in the mouse. Such mice can make human antibodies suitable for use as human therapeutics, but these mice display substantial problems with their immune systems. These problems (1) make the mice impractical for generating a sufficiently diverse antibody repertoire, (2) require the use of extensive re-engineering fixes, (3) provide a suboptimal clonal selection process likely due to incompatibility between human and mouse elements, and (4) render these mice an unreliable source of large and diverse populations of human variable sequences needed to be truly useful for making human therapeutics.\n\nThere remains a need in the art for making improved genetically modified mice that are useful in generating immunoglobulin sequences, including human antibody sequences. There also remains a need for mice that are capable of rearranging immunoglobulin gene segments to form useful rearranged immunoglobulin genes, or capable of making proteins from altered immunoglobulin loci, while at the same time reducing or eliminating deleterious changes that might result from the genetic modifications.\n\n\nSUMMARY OF INVENTION\n\n\nIn one aspect, nucleic acid constructs, cells, embryos, mice, and methods are provided for making mice that comprise a modification that results in a nonfunctional endogenous mouse ADAM6 protein or ADAM6 gene (e.g., a knockout of or a deletion in an endogenous ADAM6 gene), wherein the mice comprise a nucleic acid sequence that encodes an ADAM6 protein or ortholog or homolog or fragment thereof that is functional in a male mouse.\n\nIn one aspect, nucleic acid constructs, cells, embryos, mice, and methods are provided for making mice that comprise a modification of an endogenous mouse immunoglobulin locus, wherein the mice comprise an ADAM6 protein or ortholog or homolog or fragment thereof that is functional in a male mouse.

    "description": "\n\nFEDERALLY SPONSORED RESEARCH\n\n\nNone\n\n\nBACKGROUND\n\n\nThis invention generally relates to means and methods for preventing crawling insects from infesting a site where food, water, or garbage is located. Many households and businesses struggle with preventing ants and other crawling insects from infesting food, water, or garbage that is not kept in an air-tight container. This can feel like a constant battle, especially for people who live in warmer climates or during summer months, when insects are more persistently searching for food and water. Some items that are commonly left out of sealed containers are routinely infested by ants, such as sugar, honey, baked goods, breakfast cereal, food scraps in the trash or compost can, leftovers at a picnic table, hummingbird feeder nectar, a pet water bowl, and wet or dry pet food, to name a few non-limiting examples.\n\nTo deter insect invasions, some homeowners and business owners opt for professional pest spraying services. This can be expensive, it must be repeated, the insecticide is applied to large areas around the building, and many people are concerned about having poisonous chemicals in close proximity to their food, families and pets. Other people forego pest-killing chemicals altogether, and keep to a strict regimen of storing foods in sealed containers. However, this doesn't solve the problem in every case, such as ant-infested hummingbird feeders, or, for example, a pet dog or cat that doesn't finish all of their food in one sitting. This leftover food attracts insects into our living spaces, creates waste of food that has to be discarded, and potentially exposes us to chemicals that the insects were exposed to.\n\nSome pet owners resort to the moat method of deterring crawling insects from pet food. This involves filling a dish with a shallow level of a liquid, such as water, and placing the food bowl in the center of this liquid. The liquid moat acts as a temporary obstacle to crawling insects. However, there are many problems with the moat method of deterring crawling insects from food. The first problem is that moats can be spilled, creating a mess. Even if a moat is not spilled, the moat liquid can evaporate, and require refilling. If not cleaned regularly, moat liquid can grow stagnant and foul, especially when pieces of pet food are dropped into it. Further, the remains of dead insects and other debris can accumulate in an unmaintained moat, creating a crossable bridge for live insects to access the food. Manufacturers have long sought a clean, low-maintenance, and effective way to prevent crawling insects from infesting food, and the moat method is not it. Insofar as I am aware, there are no truly effective insect-blocking products that are food-grade, low maintenance, long lasting, weather resistant, and easy to employ at a variety of sites where food or water is located.\n\n\nSUMMARY\n\n\nAn object of this invention is to prevent crawling insects from infesting a site where food or water is located by creating a non-poisonous barrier, such as a layer of high viscosity index petroleum based gel (HVIP-gel). In one embodiment, an inverted (upside down) cup whose inside surface is coated with HVIP-gel (referred to here as an insect deterrent cup) can be positioned between the food site and possible paths of access to the food site, creating a barrier to crawling insects and preventing infestation of the food. The insect deterrent cup can be mounted underneath a bowl that is supported by a shaft with a base that rests on the ground, the floor or a table. A plurality of insect deterrent cups can be mounted to the bottom of one large platter, tray, or container to achieve stability. Insect deterrent cups can be constructed around the legs of a table, or around the legs of a stand that supports a beehive. An insect deterrent cup can alternatively be connected inline with a string, chain, or wire that suspends a hanging hummingbird feeder.\n\nOne example of a HVIP-gel is the commercially available food grade lubricant PetrolGel. PetrolGel is sold by the McGlaughlin Oil Company as a USDA H1 authorized lubricant for use with equipment that comes into incidental contact with food. PetrolGel consists of a base oil with added thickeners. The ingredients in PetrolGel are 75-90% white mineral oil (petroleum) and less than 10% aluminum, benzoate hydrogenated tallow fatty acid iso-Pr alc. complexes. PetrolGel is a commonly used sanitary lubricant among soft serve ice cream manufacturers as well as other food processors and manufacturers. Its safety around people and food makes it an appealing alternative to insecticides. The base oil in PetrolGel has a high viscosity index of 1 0 1, which means that its viscosity is not strongly affected by changes in temperature. The melting point of PetrolGel is 195Â° F., so it will not melt in full sun in very hot climates (unlike VaselineÂ®, which has a melting point of 99Â° F.). PetrolGel is also impervious to water, so it won't wash off in the rain. All of these properties make PetrolGel a safe, effective, and long-lasting insect deterrent.\n\nThis method truly blocks crawling insects from infesting a food site. Other gels and pastes were tested for their effectiveness against crawling insects, and each one (aside from PetrolGel) eventually failed. For instance, lanolin grease dried up over a period of weeks. VaselineÂ® melted and ran off in the warm sun. Dow CorningÂ® High Vacuum Grease worked for months, but ants were able to walk across it if it was applied to the top (rather than the underside) of a horizontal surface. PetrolGel completely blocked crawling insects, except in one special case. In the experiment that led to this failure, a nugget of dog food was glued to the top of a metal plate using peanut butter as the glue, and a thin layer of PetrolGel was smeared as a barrier encircling the dog food nugget and peanut butter. The plate was placed horizontally on the ground near an active ant colony. Initially, no ants were able to cross the PetrolGel. However, after a period of about 12 hours, ants had built a bridge out of little pieces of sticks and leaves over the PetrolGel. In subsequent experiments, ants could not build such a bridge when the PetrolGel-coated surface was upside down. It was concluded that application of the PetrolGel to the underside of a surface is a component partly responsible for the longevity of its impenetrability to crawling insects. It was also noted that PetrolGel itself created an effective barrier to crawling insects, without the need for added insect deterrent substances (such as permethrin or capsaicin to name some examples).\n\nThe instant embodiment is a method of preventing crawling insects from infesting a site where food or water is located, comprising coating a surface with a layer of high viscosity index petroleum based gel (HVIP-gel), and positioning the surface across any possible path that a crawling insect could take to access the food or water site, whereby crawling insects will be unable to traverse the surface coated in the HVIP-gel and will be prevented from reaching the food or water site. The HVIP-gel may be PetrolGel.\n\nA further embodiment is an insect deterrent cup comprising a cup that is oriented upside-down, a layer of HVIP-gel that is coated on the inside surface of the cup, and a means for positioning the cup so that it intersects any possible path that a crawling insect could take to reach a site where food or water is located, whereby crawling insects will be unable to traverse the HVIP-gel and will be prevented from reaching the food or water site. The HVIP-gel may be PetrolGel.\n",

    "abstract": "A rat trap includes a frame with a tunnel or arch at a first and, the tunnel formed with a slit over the entrance. A spring is mounted on the frame and a locking mechanism can temporarily maintain the spring in tension. A cable is attached to the spring and includes a noose at a distal end. With the noose disposed in the slit, a switch such as a mechanical switch or an electrical switch is arranged to detect the presence of a rat in the tunnel below the slit. The switch operates to release the spring and withdraw the noose from the tunnel at a high rate of speed to capture the animal in the tunnel.\n\n",
    "description": "\n\nBACKGROUND\n\n\nIt has been said that if you build a better rat trap, the world will beat a path to your door. Maybe because of this, many have tried to improve on the traditional rat trap device. The problem with many rat traps is that they are unreliable and prone to allowing the rat to escape. Once caught, there is often a messy cleanup and it can be difficult to remove the animal and reset the trap, especially if the rat is still alive. What is needed is a rat trap that is clean, efficient, reliable, and versatile. The present invention addresses these needs.\n\n\nSUMMARY OF THE INVENTION\n\n\nThe present invention is a rat trap comprising a frame that houses a quantity of bait that can be used to entice a rat inside. Note: although the term âratâ is used for simplicity, it is to be understood that other animals of various sizes can be captured with the present invention and it is not limited to any particular animal or vermin. Attached to the frame is a spring loaded cable that includes a noose at the opposite end. The noose is fed through a slot in the frame such that the rat must pass through the noose to reach the bait. The spring loaded noose is triggered by a sensor or switch adjacent the bait such that the presence of the rat releases the noose. The sensor can be a pressure sensor, an optical sensor, a motion sensor, or any other type of sensor. When the sensor senses that the rat is in the noose, the sensor releases the spring loaded noose, causing the rat to be captured inside the noose against the frame. The tension of the spring can be adjusted so that the noose can either capture or kill the rat. If captured, the rat can be removed and released outside.\n\nThese and other features of the invention will best be understood with reference to the accompanying drawings and the detailed description of the invention below.\n",

    "description": "\n\nCROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS\n\n\nNot applicable.\n\n\nBACKGROUND\n\n\n\n1. Technical Field\n\n\nThe various exemplary embodiments of the disclosure relate generally to the field of fishing equipment and, more specifically, to fishing rod holders for use in conjunction with fishing rods.\n\n\n2. Related Art\n\n\nFishing is a popular outdoor activity, supporting a multi-million-dollar industry. According to a report in 2020, for example, approximately fifty-five million Americans participated in freshwater, saltwater, and fly-fishing activities. The number of people participating in recreational fishing is recognized to be increasing on a global scale.\n\nAmong the components that make up a fishing rod are the rod blank, handle (also known as grip), reel seat, and guides. A rod blank is the long flexible pole component of a fishing rod, usually made of graphite, fiberglass, or composite materials. A fishing rod reel seat secures a reel to the rod blank. Examples of reel seats include spinning, casting, and fly rod reel seats. Heavy fishing rods usually use metal reel seats while lighter rods often use graphite seats. On a typical fishing rod, the part below where the reel seat is located is known as the grip, using which allows the fisher to hold and maneuver the rod. Split grip handles are one of the popular grips for fishing rods. Many anglers prefer the traditional full grip handles. Alternatively, pistol grip handles, usually found on casting rods, are much shorter than full or split grips. Whether a rod handle has a full grip or a split grip set up, often there is also a foregrip. The size, shape, location and material of the grip and the foregrip and the type and location of the reel seat is a matter of design choice and may differ from fishing rod to fishing rod.\n\nFishing is an activity practiced all over the world. Whether on a boat or from a bank, there are different techniques, styles, or methods when it comes to fishing. One of the most popular methods of fishing is bait fishing. Bait fishing is performed by casting out a form of artificial or live bait, suitable for the fish species being targeted. The angler then waits for a fish to strike the bait offering. During the substantial periods usually devoted to bait fishing, there can be considerable time between bites or strikes. While an angler is waiting for a fish to strike, the fishing rod is commonly placed into a rod holder, presenting viable options. A few examples of which include: hands-free convenience; the ability to use multiple fishing rods at the same time, increasing the chances of catching fish; and, by keeping the rod tip high, allow the angler to see when he or she is getting a bite.\n\nA fishing rod holder can make fishing more enjoyable and even more successful. The role of a rod holder is not just to give a fisher's hands a break. Fishing rod holders range from a forked stick driven into the terrain alongside a body of water to tubes which can be embedded into the shore, or bank, of a body of water and to adjustable models mountable on fishing boats. Rod holders are particularly suitable for bait fishing. An example of a fishing rod holder useable for fishing from the shore is shown in \n\nReferring to \n\nMany sporting goods stores and hunting and fishing retail stores offer a variety of fishing rod holders for freshwater or saltwater use. However, conventional fishing rod holders tend to be relatively bulky and cumbersome to carry. For many anglers, the need to store conventional fishing rod holders between fishing outings, and efforts to locate the rod holders when packing for an outing, can be wearisome. Fishing rod holders are an item easily forgotten when packing for a fishing trip.\n\nThere is a continuing need for improved fishing rod holders.\n\n\nBRIEF SUMMARY\n\n\nVarious exemplary embodiments in accordance with the disclosure provide fishing rod holders.

    "description": "\n\nFIELD\n\n\nThe present invention relates to an inflation device used in a tactical training or a wildlife mitigation setting.\n\n\nCOMPUTER PROGRAM LISTING APPENDIX\n\n\nThe present application includes a computer program listing appendix. The computer program listing is intended to comprise a part of the complete written description of the invention pursuant to 35 U.S.C. Â§ 112. The appendix contains ASCII text files of the computer program as follows:\n\nNone\n\n\nBACKGROUND\n\n\nCombat training, also known as tactical training, is an important tool used to prepare and train military forces, police departments, and civilians on how to react to live-fire situations. Tactical training often combines technical and drill training and focuses on training personnel with organization, weaponry, and tactical resources in different types of battle. To make the training most valuable, conditions must be met to mock a situation of a high-intensity shooting so that those training can have a more authentic approach when confronting an armed attack. It is important for those training to be hyperaware of their surroundings and overcome the side effects that come with the adrenaline rush responses to live-fire situations such as a raising heartbeat and shaking hands.\n\nMost affordable tactical training setups involve stationary targets set up in a field, training room, or in a course staged to resemble a real-life scenario where an active shooter may be present such as a school, multi-level building, office, etc. The targets are often paper or cardboard that display a silhouette of a person. As the user moves through the course, they shoot rounds at the stationary paper targets. Often, even after shooting the target, it remains standing upright, which can cause uncertainty to the trainee about whether the target was accurately shot. Additionally, because of the limitations of the placement of stationary targets, those who repeat the training course multiple times can often predict where the targets are placed, and thus, do not have a realistic response when spotting and shooting at the targets. Overall, a major problem with stationary paper silhouette targets is that they do not accurately mimic a realistic shooting scenario where targets are constantly moving and hiding and thus, this style of training causes situational conditioning.\n\nA problem with stationary paper silhouettes targets is that they do not accurately mimic a realistic shooting scenario in order to train those in combat and civilians most effectively. Alternative solutions to training with a stationary target are team combat training or virtual reality training. In team combat training, groups split up into teams and train against each other. To prevent injury, typically SimunitionÂ® or AirsoftÂ® brand guns are used instead of live rounds. Though team combat training more closely resembles a realistic scenario, it is limited to the requirement of a group of personnel willing to participate, and thus, is not suitable for individual training. Alternatively, virtual reality training also provides a more realistic setting. However, personnel are unable to shoot at live targets, and there is the possibility of glitching which would interfere with the effectiveness of the training. A major limitation to both of these solutions is that they are costly, require a lot of equipment, and have strict guidelines, which prevents large-scale use.\n\nAn inflatable device programmed to move rapidly and randomly can also aid in wildlife mitigation measures to prevent property damage, crop consumption, and waste production of wildlife in various outdoor areas because rapid and random movement will prevent situational conditioning of wildlife.\n\nFarm fields, lawns, docks, shorelines, etc., are vulnerable to property damage, crop consumption, and waste production from wildlife, such as birds, rats, mice, squirrels, raccoons, groundhogs, beaver, deer, coyotes, etc. These animals often come to an area in search of food which can cause a variety of damage to fields of crops, grass, and plants. Some animals come to an area in search of shelter which can cause property damage by animal digging and borrowing. Animals such as birds and squirrels are notorious for destroying outdoor furniture by ripping and shredding materials to be used in a nest.\n\nIn an attempt to resolve this issue in the past, inflatable devices have been created to attempt to ward off animals or invasive species. A major limitation with these inflation devices is the inflation rate of the inflation member, dependent on the motor or blower used to initiate inflation. Typically, the inflation members inflate at very slow rates which does not cause rapid movement. Thus, animals will become accustomed to the device, and will not be easily scared enough to leave the area. Typically, past inflation devices for wildlife mitigation activate as soon as movement is detected by an animal and deflate shortly after. Thus, another limitation to these past inflation devices is the lack of a randomized component to randomly inflate or deflate the inflation member in order to add an element of surprise. These past inflation devices have predictable movement that animals easily become accustomed to, and therefore will not prevent them from staying in the guarded area.\n\nThus, there is a long-felt need for tactical training equipment that is affordable, requires little equipment, and has easy guidelines.\n\nThere is also a long-felt need for an inflatable tactical training device programmed to inflate rapidly and randomly in order to simulate a realistic live-fire situation during tactical training exercises.\n\nFurther, there is a long-felt need for an inflatable tactical training device with a fast rate of inflation to stimulate a realistic live-fire scenario with fast-moving targets.\n\nStill further, there is a long-felt need for an inflation device used in a wildlife mitigation setting that adds a major element of surprise through rapid and randomized movement to scare off animals in a guarded area in order to prevent property damage.\n\n\nSUMMARY\n\n\nThe present invention broadly comprises an inflation device having a base with a top surface containing an aperture and a control device, a motor having a shaft mounted within the base and controlled by the control device, a propeller fixedly secured to the motor to produce an upward thrust, an inflation member secured to the base, circumscribing the aperture, and arranged for inflation by the upward thrust of the propeller, a plurality of wireless motion sensors spaced in the vicinity of the base to detect the presence of movement and to communicate with the control device to initiate inflation of the inflation member, and a random time generator to control random inflation of the inflation member.\n\nIn a preferred embodiment, the present invention further comprises a motor with a speed of at least 8200 RPM to produce an upward thrust for near-instantaneous inflation of the inflation member, although motors operating at a speed below 8200 RPM may also achieve an upward thrust that is sufficient to produce near-instantaneous inflation.\n\nThe present invention also comprises a random time generator in communication with a control device, wherein the random time generator is programmed to activate when movement is detected by the motion sensors to generate a time delay from the detection of movement by the motion sensors to initiate the inflation of the inflation member, and/or to control the time the inflation member remains inflated, and/or to control the reactivation of inflation of the inflation member after the initial trigger of the motion sensors.\n\nA primary object of the invention is to provide an inflation device that inflates quickly and has randomized activation and movement.\n\nAnother object of the invention is to provide a method for using the inflation device in a tactical training setting, wherein several of the inflation devices are placed in random areas of a tactical training course and a user walks through the course for the purpose of detecting and shooting the inflation device targets comprising the steps of detecting movement of user moving through the training course by a set of said plurality of motion sensors, transmitting radio frequency (RF) signals from said plurality of motion sensors to said receiver of said control devices operating under the same frequency as the first set of plurality of motion sensors, activating said motor, said propeller, said random time generator, and said random noise generator of said inflation device, inflating of said inflation member of any one or all of said inflation devices activated, user detecting the inflating inflation member, user shooting at the inflating inflation member, and repeating the steps from start to finish as the user continues moving through the training course to the end of the course.\n\nA further object of the invention is to provide an inflation device to be used in a tactical training setting that has rapid and random movement to create a realistic live-fire experience to prepare and train military forces, police departments, and civilians on how to react to live-fire situations.\n\nYet another object of the invention is to provide a method for using the inflation device in a wildlife mitigation setting, wherein several of the inflation devices are placed in random areas of a space that requires control comprising the steps of detecting movement of wildlife within a controlled area by a set of the plurality of motion sensors, transmitting radio frequency (RF) signals from the plurality of motion sensors to the receiver of the control devices operating under the same frequency as the first set of the plurality of motion sensors, activating the motor, the propeller, the random time generator, and the random noise generator of the inflation device, inflating of the inflation member of any one or all of the inflation devices activated, and repeating the steps from start to finish until the plurality of motion sensors no longer detects wildlife movement within the controlled area.\n\nYet even further, another object of the invention is to provide an inflation device used for wildlife mitigation that has rapid and random movement to prevent situational conditioning of animals to prevent property damage of animals and invading species.\n\nThese and other objects, features, and advantages of the invention will become readily apparent to one having ordinary skill in the art upon study of the following detailed description in view of the drawings and appended claims.\n",

    "abstract": "A method for remarkably enhancing plant disease controlling effects, and a method for controlling plant diseases are provided. A method for enhancing plant disease controlling effects of an aryl phenyl ketone fungicide includes using an aryl phenyl ketone fungicide as a component (a) in combination with at least one component (b) selected from the group consisting of a nonionic surfactant, an anionic surfactant, a cationic surfactant, a vegetable oil, a paraffin, a resin and a terpene.\n\n",
    "description": "\n\nTECHNICAL FIELD\n\n\nThe present invention relates to a method for remarkably enhancing plant disease controlling effects, particularly penetration effects and curative effects of an aryl phenyl ketone fungicide using a component such as a specific surfactant, and a method for controlling plant diseases using a component such as a specific surfactant and an aryl phenyl ketone fungicide.\n\n\nBACKGROUND ART\n\n\nCommon phytopathogenic fungi cause plant diseases by invading and proliferating of pathogenic fungi inside the cells of parasitic plants. Accordingly, in order to control plant diseases after the onset, only a compound having translocation properties and penetration properties into plant cells can achieve penetration effects, curative effects, etc.\n\nCompounds having translocation properties and penetration properties into plants are likely to penetrate into the plant and may have high controlling effects within a growth optimum temperature within which the plant has active metabolism and remarkably grows (for example, cucumber, eggplant, sweet pepper, water melon, melon, etc.: 25 to 30Â° C., wheat, barley, etc.: 10 to 25Â° C., cabbage, Chinese cabbage, strawberry, lettuce, carrot, etc.: 15 to 20Â° C., tomato, etc.: 15 to 25Â° C.), however, even compounds having high translocation properties and penetration properties may have lowered translocation properties and penetration properties and sometimes have practically no sufficient controlling effects at temperature lower than the growth optimum temperature.\n\nMost of powdery mildew pathogens (16 genera, about 900 species) are âsurface parasitesâ which parasitize only on the surface of the plant and have such a form that the pathogen remains outside the plant cell and makes only the haustorium infiltrate into the plant cell to obtain nutrition. Accordingly, even compounds having no translocation properties and penetration properties into the plant (for example, sulfur, chlorothalonil, kresoxim-methyl, etc.) and compounds having no sufficient translocation properties and penetration properties to show adequate fungicidal activity inside the plant cell (for example, potassium hydrogencarbonate, iminoctadine, etc.) show curative effects against most of powdery mildew. However, some of powdery mildew pathogens, for example, sweet pepper powdery mildew and pear powdery mildew, are âendoparasitesâ which parasitize inside the plant body, and against powdery mildew caused by such pathogens, only compounds having high translocation properties and penetration properties have sufficient curative effects, penetration effects, etc.\n\nAs representative compounds of an aryl phenyl ketone fungicide, pyriofenone and metrafenone are mentioned, and they are known to be effective against various plant diseases and have excellent preventive effects and curative effects particularly against powdery mildew. Aryl phenyl ketone compounds have translocation properties and penetration properties and are effective against even endoparasitic powdery mildew. However, they sometimes have practically no sufficient controlling effects depending upon the plant growth stage and growth conditions such as the temperature, the humidity and the amount of insolation, for example, at the time of application under temperature conditions lower than the growth optimum temperature.\n\nPatent Document 1 discloses that a benzoylpyridine derivative containing pyriofenone which is an active ingredient of the present invention is useful as a fungicide and further discloses that it may be formulated into various preparations as mixed with various adjuvants as the case requires. However, it failed to specifically disclose a method for enhancing controlling effects by using pyriofenone and a specific surfactant or the like in combination, and it does not disclose a method for enhancing controlling effects of metrafenone at all.\n\nPatent Document 2 discloses that a fungicidal composition comprising a benzoylpyridine derivative or its salt including pyriofenone which is an active ingredient of the present invention, and at least one member selected from the group consisting of eight activity-enhancing ingredients, has improved curative effects against wheat powdery mildew and vapor effects. However, it failed to specifically disclose a method for enhancing penetration effects, curative effects, residual effects, etc. against powdery mildew other than wheat powdery mildew, by using pyriofenone and a specific surfactant or the like in combination, and it does not disclose a method for enhancing controlling effects of metrafenone at all.\n\nPatent Document 3 discloses a fungicidal 2-methoxybenzophenone compound including metrafenone which is an active ingredient of the present invention, and its controlling effects against wheat powdery mildew and cucumber powdery mildew. However, it does not disclose a method for enhancing controlling effects of metrafenone at all.\n\n\nPRIOR ART DOCUMENTS\n\n\n\nPatent Documents\n\n\nNone\n\n\nDISCLOSURE OF INVENTION\n\n\n\nTechnical Problem\n\n\nAn aryl phenyl ketone fungicide which is an active ingredient of the present invention has effects against various plant pathogens. However, it sometimes has practically no sufficient controlling effects due to insufficient penetration effects, curative effects, residual effects or fungicidal effects at a temperature lower than the plant growth optimum temperature.\n\nIt is an object of the present invention to remarkably enhance controlling effects against various plant pathogens by using an aryl phenyl ketone fungicide and a component such as a specific surfactant in combination to enhance penetration effects, curative effects, etc.\n\n\nSolution to Problem\n\n\nThe present inventors have conducted extensive studies to solve the above problem and as a result, found that by adding a component such as a specific surfactant when an aryl phenyl ketone fungicide is applied, excellent penetration effects, curative effects, etc. can be obtained, which are unexpected from a case where the aryl phenyl ketone fungicide is used individually, and accomplished the present invention.\n\nThat is, the present invention provides a method for enhancing plant disease controlling effects of (a) an aryl phenyl ketone fungicide (hereinafter sometimes referred to simply as a component (a)) by using at least one component selected from the group consisting of a nonionic surfactant, an anionic surfactant, a cationic surfactant, a vegetable oil, a paraffin, a resin and a terpene (hereinafter sometimes referred to simply as a component (b)), and a method for controlling plant diseases, which comprises applying the component (a) and the component (b) to plants or to soil where they grow.\n\n\nAdvantageous Effects of Invention\n\n\nThe present invention, which has stably high controlling effects against plant diseases, is useful for controlling plant diseases.\n",

    "description": "\n\nFIELD OF THE INVENTION\n\n\nThis disclosure relates to ultrasonic transducers and, in one specific application, an ultrasonic transducer for wind turbine application in order to deter bats.\n\n\nBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION\n\n\nWind power via wind turbines is beneficial to humans but can harm or kill bats that fly into the turbine blades. Ultrasonic sound in the frequency range of 25 kHz-100 kHz may be effective at deterring bats by interfering with the sonar used by bats to hunt insects. Thus, U.S. Pat. No. 9,706,766, incorporated herein by this reference, discloses a nozzle located on the turbine nacelle emitting ultrasonic sound when pressurized air flows through the nozzle, But, this system requires a source of pressurized air and the required plumbing from the source to the nozzle.\n\nU.S. Pat. No. 10,034,471, also incorporated herein by this reference, discloses acoustic transmitters in sockets formed in the wind turbine blades and arranged along the length of the wind turbine blades. But, installation of such transducers may be problematic.\n\n\nBRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION\n\n\nFeatured is a new ultrasonic transducer particularly adapted, in one aspect, for wind turbine blades. The transducer is sealed against environmental conditions and operable even when exposed to water, freeze/thaw cycles, and vacuum/pressure cycling. Further featured is an ultrasonic transducer which is not affected in operation when exposed to 20 g acceleration forces for extended periods of time. Also featured is an ultrasonic transducer having an extremely low profile to avoid excessive drag and/or noise. Also featured is an ultrasonic transducer capable of sound pressure levels of 80 dB at 20 meters. Further featured is an ultrasonic transducer having a wide beam angle. Further featured is an ultrasonic transducer having a high electrical to acoustic energy conversion efficiency in order to minimize power when multiple transducers are installed on a single turbine blade. Further featured is a broad band ultrasonic transducer covering, in one example, 20 kHz to 60 kHz in order to provide warning for multiple species of bats. Further featured is a lightweight transducer.\n\nFeatured is an ultrasonic transducer for wind turbine applications. A housing includes a central diaphragm portion, a peripheral wall thereabout, and a flexure portion supporting the diaphragm portion relative to the peripheral wall. A cone has an apex secured to the housing central diaphragm portion and a peripheral rim secured to the metal housing peripheral wall. A driver is secured to the housing central diaphragm portion opposite the cone apex. The transducer may be coupled to one or more blades of a wind turbine.\n\nThe driver is preferably a piezoelectric element. The housing and cone may be made of metal. In one example, the flexure is vertically stiff to support the housing central diaphragm portion and the metal cone and compliant in flexure allowing the housing central diaphragm portion to flex.\n\nIn one example, the flexure portion depends downward from the central diaphragm portion and the flexure portion is connected to the peripheral wall by a lateral outwardly extending portion. In another example, the flexure portion extends upward from the central diaphragm portion and the flexure portion is connected to the peripheral wall by a lateral outwardly extending portion. The transducer may further include a wind screen over the cone. The wind screen can be made of an acoustically transparent material. The transducer may further include a printed circuit board over the driver.\n\nThe subject invention, however, in other embodiments, need not achieve all these objectives and the claims hereof should not be limited to structures or methods capable of achieving these objectives.\n",

    "description": "\n\nFIELD OF THE INVENTION\n\n\nThe invention relates to antimicrobial compositions including at least one acid and at least one anionic surfactant. In particular, food contact (or non-food contact) antimicrobial compositions including at least one acid and at least one anionic surfactant provide a no-rinse composition efficacious for sanitizing and against Norovirus, having acceptable use solution pH that do not require use of personal protective equipment (PPE), are surface compatible and do not result in streaky, hazy or tacky residues on treated surfaces. The compositions are suitable for use as hard surface antimicrobial compositions, including ware wash applications, 3\n\n\nBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION\n\n\nMicrobial and Viral pathogens are an increasing public health concern. Pathogenic viruses present a significant health concern as they are able to persist on surfaces for longer periods of time and require complete and reliable inactivation in order to stop disease transmission. Viruses can be identified according to a hierarchy that correspondences with the level of resistance to being inactivated. The three viral subgroups include small non-enveloped, large non-enveloped, and enveloped viruses. An antimicrobial product that is able to inactivate a small, non-enveloped virus is also able to inactivate any large, non-enveloped virus or any enveloped virus. Similarly, an antimicrobial product that can inactivate a large, non-enveloped virus is also able to inactivate any enveloped virus. Accordingly it is desirable to identify and develop antimicrobial compositions that can inactivate small, non-enveloped viruses to then be able to have corresponding antimicrobial efficacy across the viral hierarchy. Norovirus is an exemplary small, non-enveloped virus in need of additional antimicrobial compositions for surface treatment.\n\nNorovirus is an exemplary small, non-enveloped virus in need of additional antimicrobial compositions for surface treatment. The non-enveloped Norovirus (NoV), also known previously as âNorwalk-Like Virusâ (NLV) or small round structured virus, is the most important viral pathogen of epidemic acute gastroenteritis that occurs in both developed and developing countries. NoV belongs to the Caliciviridae family and are icosahedral, single stranded, positive-sense RNA viruses whose capsids are composed of 180 copies of a single major structural protein. Noroviruses are estimated to cause 23 million cases of acute gastroenteritis in the United States per year, and are the leading cause of gastroenteritis in the United States. Of viruses, only the common cold is reported more often than viral gastroenteritis (norovirus). Norovirus causes nausea, vomiting (sometimes accompanied by diarrhea), and stomach cramps. This infection typically is spread from person to person by direct contact.\n\nNoroviruses are very highly contagious and can spread easily from person to person. People can become infected with the norovirus in several ways, including, eating food or drinking liquids that are contaminated with norovirus; touching surfaces or objects contaminated with norovirus, and then placing their hands in their mouths; or having direct contact with another person who is infected and showing symptoms (for example, when caring for someone who is ill, or sharing foods or eating utensils with someone who is ill). During outbreaks of norovirus gastroenteritis, several modes of transmission have been documented, for example, initial foodborne transmission in a restaurant, followed by secondary person-to-person transmission to household contacts.\n\nQuaternary ammonium compounds have become a commonplace antimicrobial and are widely used within the foodservice industry for food contact sanitizing and disinfectant applications with disinfection claim sets requiring a follow-up rinse step. However, recent regulatory scrutiny over quaternary ammonium compounds may change the utilization of these sanitizing and disinfectant compositions.\n\nQuaternary ammonium compounds and other chemistries are utilized in products for treating Norovirus, which is a highly contagious, significant public health burden. Norovirus is one of the most difficult viruses to disinfect. Norovirus is the most common cause of epidemic gastroenteritis causing at least 50% of all outbreaks with an estimated 20 million cases in the U.S. each year and is the leading cause of foodborne illness. The financial impact is large. The cost per case of Norovirus is low relative to other foodborne illnesses but due to its high incidence the total cost of illness for Norovirus is substantial. Norovirus is sourced from the feces or vomit of an infected person and is spread through a number of ways including contact with unwashed hands, ingestion of contaminated food or water, and contact with contaminated surfaces. Studies have shown an infected person may be contagious for 2 weeks after recovery and may continue shedding virus particles in feces for as long as 2 months. Given the persistence of Norovirus, decontamination of surfaces should take place long after an infected person is no longer showing symptoms.\n\nProducts having a no-rinse capability are desirable, although they present challenges due to regulatory requirements for all active and inert ingredients to have a list tolerance designated for chemical substances used as ingredients in antimicrobial pesticide formulations applied to food-contact surfaces in public eating places, dairy-processing equipment, and food-processing equipment and utensils. Various commercially-available products exist in the marketplace that provide no-rinse options for Norovirus, including for example, Purell Professional Food Service Sanitizer as disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 8,143,309 and Pure Bioscience Pure Hard Surface as disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,197,814 and 6,583,176, the entire contents of which are incorporated by reference in their entirety. However, there are various challenges presented by the products. For example, various products present flammability concerns, impart hazy and/or tacky residues and/or poor surface appearance, having limited compatibility with soft metal surfaces (including aluminum) and are only available as ready-to-use (RTU) formulations instead of concentrates and/or solids, which limits applications of their use. As a result, there are various limitations which set in place a need for improved compositions.\n\nAccordingly, it is an objective of the compositions and methods to provide a product that can offer no-rinse disinfection without the use of quaternary ammonium compounds.\n\nA further object of the compositions and methods is to provide antimicrobial and disinfectant compositions against Norovirus (and other small, non-enveloped viruses to also provide antiviral efficacy against large, non-eveloped viruses and enveloped viruses), including short contact time, preferably 10 minutes or less, more preferably 5 minutes or less, and most preferred 1 minute or less.\n\nA further object of the compositions and methods is a treatment option providing acceptable material compatibility that supports good cleaning performance without a hazy, streaky, or tacky residue on the treated surface.\n\nA further object of the compositions and methods is a treatment option having a use solution pH that does not require the use of personal protective equipment (PPE).\n\nA still further object of the compositions and methods is to provide efficacy against biofilms.\n\nOther objects, advantages and features of the present invention will become apparent from the following specification taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.\n\n\nBRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION\n\n\nAn advantage of the compositions and methods is that antimicrobial compositions provide dilutable, non-flammable, no-rinse efficacy against microbial pathogens, including viruses such as Norovirus, while providing surface compatible formulations that do not leave hazy, streaky, or tacky residues on treated surfaces. It is a further advantage of the compositions and methods that use solution pH do not require a user to employ PPE. As still further benefits, the compositions are suitable for use as hard surface antimicrobial compositions, including ware wash applications, 3\n\nIn an embodiment, an antimicrobial composition comprises from about 10 wt-% to about 75 wt-% of at least one acid, wherein the acid is a strong acid, weak acid and/or combination thereof; at least one sulfonate, sulfate and/or carboxylate anionic surfactant; and water, wherein the composition is a dilutable liquid concentrate having an acidic pH that is non-flammable. In a further embodiment, the anionic surfactant is a C8-C22 alkyl sulfonate, and/or alpha sulfonated carboxylic acid or its ester, preferably linear alkyl benzene sulfonic acid. In a further embodiment the acids comprise lactic acid and methane sulfonic acid. In further embodiments, the compositions also include an alkoxylated nonionic surfactant having an EO/PO block copolymer. A use solution of the compositions have a pH from about 1.5 to about 4. In further embodiments, the liquid compositions can be saturated onto a wipe substrate. In still further embodiments the liquid compositions can be provided as a ready to use composition comprising from about 5 ppm to about 10,000 pm of the at least one acid and from about 10 ppm to about 6,000 ppm of the anionic surfactant.\n\nIn further embodiments, methods of using an antimicrobial composition, comprise: contacting the antimicrobial composition of claim \n\nIn an embodiment, a virucidal composition comprises from about 10 wt-% to about 75 wt-% of at least one strong acid and at least one weak acid; at least one sulfonate, sulfate and/or carboxylate anionic surfactant; and water, wherein the composition is a dilutable acidic liquid concentrate that is non-flammable, wherein a use pH of the composition is from about 1.5 to about 4. In still further embodiments, the composition of claim \n\nIn further embodiments, methods of inactivating a virus include: contacting the virucidal composition of claim \n\nWhile multiple embodiments are disclosed, still other embodiments of the present invention will become apparent to those skilled in the art from the following detailed description, which shows and describes illustrative embodiments of the invention. Accordingly, the drawings and detailed description are to be regarded as illustrative in nature and not restrictive.\n",

    "abstract": "An apparatus is disclosed having a first layer coupled to a second layer via a plurality of seals to define a storage volume that is separable by at least one intermediate seal into a first volume and a second volume. The intermediate seal is applicable after a material is introduced into the storage volume storage. The apparatus includes a first opening into the storage volume and a second opening into the storage volume. The first opening and the second opening are positioned near opposite edges. The apparatus also includes a first frangible region positioned along the intermediate seal and configured for separation of the first volume and the second volume.\n\n",
    "description": "\n\nBACKGROUND\n\n\nThe embodiments described herein relate to containers for storing, handling, packaging, and transporting material. Specifically, the embodiments described herein relate to containers for containing biological materials that have one or more seals that define multiple portions, some of which can be easily removed.\n\nKnown biological materials are used in a variety of procedures to perform medical procedures. Such procedures can include implanting bone or gum tissue to address dental or periodontal issues, bone grafting to repair fractures, and tendon grafting to repair damaged ligaments and/or tendons (e.g., repair of a torn anterior cruciate ligament), to name just a few. In many instances, the tissue implant is not taken from the patient's body (i.e., is not an autograft), but rather is from another source, such as from a human cadaver (i.e., an allograft) or an animal (i.e., a xenograft). Known non-autologous grafts are often stored in a dried condition within a sterile package, and thus must be rehydrated or otherwise prepared prior to use.\n\nSome known storage containers include a port that can be coupled to a tube set to allow fluids to be conveyed into or out of the container (e.g., to rehydrate the material stored within the container). In some instances, the port can also allow ingress or egress of flowable biological materials, such as bone chips, bone paste, blood, or cells (within a liquid medium). Many known ports include a tubular member that is sealed between opposing layers of material from which the container is constructed, and that extends from an end of the container. The inclusion of such ports increases the overall size of the container, thus such containers can require a greater volume for storage (e.g., for cold storage). This can reduce the storage capacity, which increases costs and decreases efficiency.\n\nA port that extends from the end of the container, and which is often more rigid than the remainder of the container, can also contact surrounding structures during handling. For example, some known containers include ports that can catch on a shoulder or surface of storage containers or otherwise be subjected to external forces during handling. Accordingly, the port can be a point of failure for the container.\n\nIn addition to storing grafts, known containers are also used for storage, handling, and processing of blood, cells, and other liquid biological materials. Some cell processing and handling systems include multiple containers coupled together (e.g., via a tube set) so that desired amounts of the cells can be stored in separate locations. For example, some systems include different containers for holding harvested cells removed from a culture that need to be washed separate from cells that have been washed and are ready for storage. Because some biologic materials, such as blood and cells, require quality testing of samples (e.g., to ensure that the materials are appropriate for the desired use), some known systems include separate containers for holding quality control (âQCâ) samples separately from the primary storage container. In use, the QC containers are often filled separately from the primary storage container by switching valves, tubes, or other fluid pathways during processing. Such known systems and methods, however, can be cumbersome and time consuming to properly separate the QC sample. Moreover, such known system can sometimes result in errors in ensuring that the QC sample is associated with the primary portion of the material (e.g., due to errors in valving, switching tubes, and the like).\n\nThus, a need exists for improved containers and methods for storing, transporting, and/or processing, units of biological material including improving quality control of the materials, improving the robustness of the storage of the materials, and dispersing the materials from the storage containers. Additionally, a need exists for better quality control of materials stored in containers and containers that facilitate that quality control.\n\n\nSUMMARY\n\n\nMaterial storage systems are described herein along with containers and methods for storing materials including tissue and other biological materials. In some embodiments, the system includes a first layer and a second layer. The first layer and second layer are coupled together to form a container having a first end portion, a second end portion, a first edge between the first end portion and the second end portion, and a second edge between the first end portion and the second end portion, the first edge opposite the second edge. The system includes a plurality of seals coupling the first layer and the second layer together along at least the first end portion, the second end portion, the first edge, or the second edge to define a storage volume between the first layer and the second layer. The system includes a first opening into the storage volume, with the first opening being positioned at the first end portion. The system includes at least one intermediate seal extending between the first edge and the second edge that separates the storage volume into a first volume and a second volume. The intermediate seal is applicable after a material is introduced into the storage volume such that the target material is stored within the first volume and the second volume. The system includes a frangible region extending along the intermediate seal that allows for physical separation of the container into a first container portion that includes the first volume and a second container portion that includes the second volume.\n\nIn some embodiments, the frangible region includes any of a perforation, a tear notch, or a stress concentration riser. In some embodiments, the frangible region includes a stress riser in the first layer and the second layer to initiate a tear along the frangible region. In some embodiments, the frangible region includes a first perforation defined in the first layer and a second perforation defined in the second layer, the first perforation aligned with the second perforation. In some embodiments, a width of the intermediate seal is greater than a width of the frangible region. The frangible region is proximal to the second end portion and is configured to allow removal of the second container portion by hand (i.e., without any external tools, such as a cutting blade or scissors).\n\nIn some embodiments, a first seal of the plurality of seals is located along the first edge and a second seal of the plurality of seals is located along the second edge. The system includes a port positioned along the first end portion that defines the opening. In some embodiments, the first end portion includes an end portion seal and an end portion frangible region that is configured such that in response to separation at the end portion frangible region, the port is removed from the storage volume.\n\nIn some embodiments, the second end portion includes an end portion seal that is applicable after the material is introduced to the storage volume. The end portion seal fluidically isolates the second opening from the storage volume.\n\nIn some embodiments, either of the second edge or the second container portion includes a tapered portion. The tapered portion extends from the first end portion to the second end portion of the container. Alternatively, the tapered portion extends from an end of the second edge to a tip at the second end portion. The second container portion includes the length of the tapered portion. In some embodiments, the opening into the container is a first opening and the plurality of seals coupling the first layer and the second layer includes a peelable seal at the tip. The peelable seal is configured such that the first layer can be peeled away from the second layer to produce a second opening at the tip.\n\nIn some embodiments, the first volume or the second volume are partially defined by one or more of the plurality of seals and the intermediate seal completes a closure to fully isolate the first volume and the second volume from one another. The frangible region is proximal to the second end portion and is configured to remove the tapered portion while maintaining the plurality of seals of the first container portion and the second container portion keeping them enclosed.\n\nIn some embodiments, the first volume is larger than the second volume. The first volume is more than twice the size of the second volume. In some embodiments, both the first volume and the second volume include regions that are openable to remove the material from each of the first volume and the second volume. The first volume includes a port and the second volume include a peelable region. The second container portion includes a plurality of graduated markings that indicate quantity of the material stored therein. The second volume is larger than the first volume.\n\nIn some embodiments, the first container portion includes a first indicium associated with the target material and the second container portion includes a second indicium associated with at least one of the first indicium, the first container portion, or the target material.\n\nIn some embodiments, the second volume includes a plurality of ports extending to an exterior of the container. At least one of the first layer or the second layer includes a separation tab extending from an exterior portion of the first layer or the second layer and oriented such that a user can grip the tab and separate the first layer from the second layer.\n\nIn some embodiments, a storage container includes a first layer and a second layer. The first layer and second layer are coupled together to form a container having a first end portion, a second end portion, a first edge between the first end portion and the second end portion, and a second edge between the first end portion and the second end portion. The first edge is opposite the second edge. The storage container includes a plurality of seals coupling the first layer and the second layer together along at least the first end portion, the second end portion, the first edge, or the second edge to define a storage volume between the first layer and the second layer. The storage container includes a port coupled to the first end portion of the container that defines an opening into the storage volume. The storage container includes an end portion seal at the first end portion of the container that fluidically isolates the port from the storage volume. The storage container includes an end portion frangible region extending between the first edge and the second edge along of the end portion seal. The end portion frangible region is configured for physically separating the port from the storage volume while keeping the storage volume isolated.\n\nIn some embodiments, the storage container includes an at least one intermediate seal extending between the first edge and the second edge, the storage volume being separable into a first volume and a second volume by the at least one intermediate seal. The intermediate seal is applicable after a material is introduced into the storage volume. The storage container includes an intermediate frangible region extending along the at least one intermediate seal that allows for physical separation between the first volume and the second volume defining a first container portion storing the material and a second container portion storing the material. The first volume or the second volume are partially defined by one or more of the plurality of seals and the at least one intermediate seal completes a closure to fully isolate the first volume and the second volume from one another. The intermediate frangible region includes a stress riser in the first layer and the second layer to initiate a tear along the intermediate frangible region.\n\nIn some embodiments, the second end portion includes an end portion seal that is applicable after the material is introduced to the storage volume. The end portion seal is a peelable seal. The storage container tapers along the second edge extending from the first end portion to the second end portion. The storage container tapers from an end of the second edge to the second end portion. The second container portion includes the length of the tapered portion of the storage container.\n\nIn some embodiments, the frangible region is proximal to the second end portion and is configured to remove the tapered portion forming an opening into the first container portion. The end portion frangible region is proximal to the second end portion and is configured to remove the tapered portion while maintaining the plurality of seals keeping the first container portion and the second container portion enclosed.\n\nIn some embodiments, the tapered region includes graduated markings that indicate quantity of a material stored therein. The second volume is larger than the first volume. The second volume includes a plurality of ports extending to an exterior of the container. At least one of the first layer or the second layer includes a separation tab extending from an exterior portion of the first layer or the second layer and oriented such that a user can grip the tab and separate the first layer from the second layer.\n\nIn some embodiments, a method of storing a material includes providing a storage container having a storage volume defined between a first layer of the storage container and a second layer of the storage container. The storage container includes an opening. The method includes inserting the material into the storage volume via the opening. The method includes sealing the opening to enclose the storage volume. The method includes applying an intermediate seal separating the storage volume into a first volume and a second volume with the material being in both the first volume and the second volume. In some embodiments, the storage container includes a frangible region along the intermediate seal allowing the first volume and the second volume to be physically separated by hand along the frangible region. The method optionally includes separating the first volume from the second volume along the frangible region located along the intermediate seal. Additionally, or alternatively, the method can include separating and storing the second volume for future reference to the material stored therein. This allows ongoing testing and verification of the material to understand what material was used in the first volume. Additionally, or alternatively, the method can include dispending the material from either the first volume or the second volume. The material can be used, tested, or stored. Since both volumes contain materials that match the other volume, one can serve as a reference material after the other volume is used.\n",

    "description": "\n\nTECHNICAL FIELD\n\n\nThe present disclosure relates to the field of biotechnology, and in particular, to methods and compositions for inhibiting the formation of biofilms.\n\n\nBACKGROUND\n\n\nBiofilm (or âbacteria biofilmâ) generally refers to communities of microorganisms encased by extracellular polymeric substances (EPS), and is prevalent in natural, industrial, and clinical settings. The biofilm may enhance the survival of the microorganisms, enabling them to adapt to diverse environments. For example, in the medical field, studies have indicated that about 65% of human bacterial infections are related to biofilms, and antibiotic resistance of the microorganisms in the biofilms is hundreds or even thousands of times higher than that in a plankton state. Biofilm bacteria have a strong resistance to antibiotics and the host immune system, giving rise to serious clinical problems and many chronic infectious that are notoriously difficult to eradicate.\n\nOne of the most important features of biofilms is self-secreted extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) consisting of mainly polysaccharides, proteins, and extracellular DNA (eDNA), which function as a matrix or glue, holding biofilm cells together and protecting cells from antibiotics and shear forces in fluid environments. By forming a matrix-encased multicellular aggregate, cells can also escape engulfment by phagocytic cells within a mammalian host. EPS not only promote microorganisms (e.g., bacteria) to attach all kinds of surfaces (e.g., a biomedical material or a mucosal surface of a biological organism), but also trap antibiotics or influence antibiotics to penetrate into the bacterial communities. Therefore, in some cases, most drugs can only kill microorganisms on the outer layer of the biofilm, yet microorganisms inside the biofilm can escape the killing effect of antibiotics to survive continuously, which is also the main reason for the generation of antibiotic-resistance mutation. Thus, the biofilms become a potential source of injections, which may cause refractory infections relating to clinical biofilms.\n\nAnother feature of the bacteria is to produce virulence factors having toxicity, for example, \n\n\nSUMMARY\n\n\nOne aspect of some embodiments of the present disclosure provides a method for inhibiting formation of a biofilm of bacteria.

    "description": "\n\nBACKGROUND\n\n\nPathogenic microbes include viruses, bacteria and fungi as well as some single-celled organisms such as amoebae. Chemical agents are needed to kill these pathogens. Generally known as disinfectants, there are a number of commercially available chemicals useful for killing pathogenic microbes, such as alcohol, bleach, quaternary ammonium compounds, soap and hydrogen peroxide. These are applied externally to surfaces on which microbes may attach or proliferate. A limited selection of broad-spectrum antimicrobials is approved for limited in-vivo use, such as cetylpyridinium chloride in mouthwash.\n\nFor effective contact-killing of microbes, disinfectants need to remain in contact with microbes for a minimal time, even a few seconds. Molecules with low vapor pressure, such as soaps or surfactants, remain on surfaces longer, whereas ethanol or isopropanol evaporate relatively quickly. In addition, small molecules are easily wiped off smooth surfaces, limiting the time that surface may be considered microbe-free.\n\nThe mechanism of antimicrobial activity varies according to the disinfectant used. Surfactants are thought to kill microbes directly by disrupting their cell membranes. Well-suited for this purpose are cationic surfactants, such as quaternary ammonium salts which include the well-known disinfectant Lysol. The mechanism of cell membrane disruption is thought to be aided by the interaction of the positive charge on the surfactant with negative charges on the cell membrane.\n\nThere is a need for an effective disinfectant that can be applied to a surface, alone or in conjunction with other disinfectants that also remains on said surface and is resistant to removal by wiping or washing.\n\n\nSUMMARY\n\n\nDescribed herein are antimicrobial copolymers comprising (i) a polymer backbone and a plurality of thiouronium groups covalently bonded to the polymer backbone and (ii) a plurality of quaternary ammonium groups covalently bonded to the polymer backbone.

Traditional methods of reducing ischemic damage involve perfusing affected tissues with oxygen, but this procedure can cause significant tissue damage and can result in serious and/or permanent injury, such as brain damage during stroke or cardiac arrest.\n\nAttempts have been made to reduce ischemia and reperfusion injury by inducing tissues and organs to enter a reduced metabolic state. For example, in the context of living tissues being preserved for transplant or grafting, one common method for reducing their metabolic activity is by immersing tissues or organs in a physiologic fluid, such as saline, and placing them in a cold environment. However, such methods cannot be relied upon for extended periods, and the success of organ transplant and limb reattachments remains inversely related to the time the organ or limb is out of contact with the intact organism.\n\nThus, there remains a need in the art for organs with improved viability prior ischemia and/or reperfusion injury.\n\n\nSUMMARY\n\n\nIn an aspect, the present disclosure encompasses a method to improve the viability of an organ intended for transplant, the method comprising continuously administering a composition comprising NO\n\nIn another aspect, the present disclosure encompasses a method to improve the viability of an organ damaged by ischemia-reperfusion, the method comprising continuously administering a composition comprising not more than about 20 ppm of NO\n\nIn another aspect, the present disclosure encompasses a method to improve the viability of an organ damaged by ischemia-reperfusion, the method comprising (a) administering to the organ a composition comprising about 20 ppm to about 40 ppm NO\n\nIn another aspect, the present disclosure encompasses a method to improve the viability of an organ intended for transplant, the method comprising continuously administering a composition comprising 20 ppm or less of NO\n\nIn another aspect, the present disclosure encompasses a method to improve the viability of an organ intended for transplant, the method comprising (a) administering to the organ a composition comprising about 20 ppm to about 40 ppm NO\n\nIn another aspect, the present disclosure encompasses methods to treat ischemia-reperfusion damage in an organ in need thereof, the method comprising continuously administering a composition comprising 20 ppm or less of NO\n\nIn another aspect, the present disclosure encompasses methods to treat ischemia-reperfusion damage in an organ in need thereof, the method comprising (a) administering to the organ a composition comprising about 20 ppm to about 40 ppm NO\n\nIn another aspect, the present disclosure provides methods for transplantation, the method comprising (a) continuously administering a composition comprising 20 ppm or less of NO\n\nIn another aspect, the present disclosure provides methods for transplantation, the method comprising (a) administering to the organ a composition comprising about 20 ppm to about 40 ppm NO\n\nOther aspects and iterations of the disclosure are described more thoroughly below.\n",

Compared to other protection strategies, such as foliar/furrow spraying during crop season, seed treatment can achieve a low-cost crop protection since the treatment requires a relatively small amount of active ingredients, allows for disease control, and prevents contamination of carcinogenic mycotoxins at the earlier stage of crop growth, and lowers resistance transmission. The development of novel seed-treatment products that can be applied as alternatives to the conventional, toxic chemical compositions will also facilitate sustainable crop management.\n\nThe viability of crop seeds is greatly affected by âabioticâ and âbioticâ stresses, for which the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) is the contributing mechanism of the toxicity (Kurek, K., et al., Plants (Basel), 8(6): 174 (2019). ROS accumulation during seed desiccation or aging is an example of abiotic stress where the seed damage by ROS results in the degradation/deterioration of cellular components such as membrane phospholipids, proteins, and genetic materials (Kumar, S. P. J., et al., Ann. Bot., 116: 663-668 (2015); Ratajczak, E., et al., J. Plant Physiol., 174:147-156 (2015)). Consequently, the oxidative damages in crop seeds cause lowered germination rate and loss of seed viability, leading to significant crop losses.\n\nContamination of crop seeds by pathogens, especially those resistant to conventional biocides, represents a major biotic stress. Plant defense against pathogens also involves oxidative-stress response. Moreover, outbreaks of commodity-specific food sources, such as maize contamination by hepato-carcinogenic and kidney-damaging mycotoxins produced by fungi, directly affect the health and safety of the public. It has been estimated that fungi cause Ë30% of world crop/food losses; Fisher, M. C., et al., Science, 360(6390):739-742 (2018).\n\nHeat treatment became one of the important strategies for the prevention of pathogen contamination in pre- and post-harvest agricultural or food production (Hansen, J. D., and J. A. Johnson, Int. J. Pest. Manag. 57(4): 267-289 (2011); Dagnas, S., and J. M. MembrÃ©, J. Food Prot., 76: 538-551 (2013)). Artificially applied heat negatively affects the growth of pathogenic microbes, thus ensuring the reduction of pathogen contamination or postharvest decay. For instance, high heat treatment (e.g., 70Â° C.) is one of the postharvest practices to prevent fungal contamination in corn and thereby the production of the hepato-carcinogenic aflatoxins (Hawkins, L. K., et al., J. Food Prot., 68: 1521-1524 (2005)). Thermal treatment (e.g., 70Â° C.) significantly reduced the infection of aflatoxigenic \n\nTherefore, there is a high demand for the development of new, alternative strategies which warrant early intervention of pathogen/toxin contamination and the quality of harvested crops. Development of resistance of pathogens to thermal treatments is also an increasing public health concern, especially for food safety sectors (Peng, J., et al., Crit. Rev. Food Sci. Nutr., 57: 2970-2995 (2015); Ros-Chumillas, M., et al., J. Food Prot., 78: 2019-2023 (2015)).\n\nHurdle technology is an approach where combined application of different types of preservation methods at reduced individual intensities could achieve increases in the effectiveness of antimicrobial treatments (Leistner, L., Int. J. Food Microbiol., 55: 181-186 (2000)). Examples of heat-based hurdle technology include: (1) Enhancement of food safety of fresh-cut bell pepper by inactivating \n\nRecently, natural products were included in heat-based hurdle technologies for pathogen control which are considered ecologically benign. For example, augmentation of the antimicrobial potency of Cu\n\nWe found a new utility for long-chain alkyl gallates as heat-sensitizing agents which enables high-efficiency pathogen intervention under decreased temperatures, and seed protection.\n\n\nSUMMARY OF THE INVENTION\n\n\nDisclosed are methods of protecting seeds simultaneously from oxidants and microorganisms (e.g., fungi, bacteria) prior to planting the seeds, involving coating the seeds with an antioxidant effective amount and an antimicrobial effective amount of a composition containing at least one compound selected from the group consisting of C\n\nThis summary is provided to introduce a selection of concepts in a simplified form that are further described below in the detailed description.

    "description": "\n\nTECHNICAL FIELD\n\n\nThis invention is directed to compositions and uses of beflubutamid in combination with a second herbicide, and optionally one or more further herbicides.\n\n\nBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION\n\n\nThe protection of crops from undesirable plants known as weeds that can interfere with crop growth and can reduce crop yield has long been a goal in agriculture. One approach that has been taken to achieve this goal is the development of selective herbicides that control weeds without exhibiting unacceptable phytotoxicity to the crops sought to be protected. Herbicides of many types have been disclosed in the literature and a number are in commercial use.\n\nWith the development of chemical crop protection and the increasing availability of effective selective herbicides, monocultures of crops have become common. This has led to repeated application of the same or similar herbicides to these crops. In conservation or zero-tillage crop establishment systems, cultivation for weed control has largely been replaced by the use of selective and non-selective herbicides. Thus, two prevailing conditions are present in these cropping systems: (i) the frequent use of a limited range of effective herbicides and (ii) reliance upon these herbicides to the exclusion of other forms of weed control. Where these conditions prevail, herbicide-resistant weeds will increase in frequency (i.e. evolve) if there is heritable variability in response to herbicide application in weed populations and selective mortality from the herbicides.\n\nMore recently, crops have been protected from weeds by genetically modifying the crop to be tolerant to a non-selective herbicide (such as glyphosate or glufosinate) and applying such herbicide over the top of such crops. Unfortunately, this latter approach has led to the evolution of herbicide-resistant weeds, with the result that there is still a need for a means of selectively controlling undesirable vegetation in crops.\n\nEP 239 414 A discloses the preparation of beflubutamid and isomers thereof and describes combined use of beflubutamid and thiobencarb.\n\nEP 352 992 A2 discloses herbicidal compositions of beflubutamid and cyanazine or mecoprop.\n\nEP 901 753 A1 discloses herbicidal compositions of beflubutamid in combination with a second herbicide selected from nitrile compounds having herbicidal activity, double phenoxy, amide and cyclohexanedione compounds having controlling activity against gramineous weeds, sulfonylurea compounds having herbicidal activity and diphenyl ether compounds having herbicidal activity.\n\nWO 2007/101587 A1 discloses herbicidal compositions of beflubutamid and (2E)-4-[2-chloro-5-[4-chloro-5-(difluoromethoxy)-1-methyl-1H-pyrazol-3-yl]-4-fluorophenoxy]-3-methoxy-2-butenoic acid methyl ester.\n\nWO 2009/029518 A2 discloses herbicidal compositions of beflubutamid and pyridine and pyrimidine carboxylic acids.\n\nCN 102283234B discloses herbicidal compositions of beflubutamid and the sulfonylureas chlorosulfuron, cyclosulfamuron.

This invention provides novel compositions for protecting crops from undesirable vegetation (often referred to as âweedsâ). The present disclosure is based on the discovery that beflubutamid and a second herbicide (as further specified herein) display an âenhancedâ herbicidal effects when applied in combination. In some embodiments, the beflubutamid is in the racemic form. In other embodiments, the beflubutamid is optically enriched, in particular optically enriched with respect to the (â)-enantiomer.\n\nOne aspect of the invention is directed to a composition herbicidal containing a first herbicide beflubutamid, and a second herbicide (as further specified herein, andâas will be appreciatedâdifferent from the first herbicide beflubutamid); and the use thereof in controlling undesirable vegetation which interfere with crop growth. Another aspect of the invention is directed to a herbicidal composition comprising a first herbicide beflubutamid, at least one second herbicide (as further specified herein), and at least one formulation component selected from formulation agents for emulsifiable concentrate (EC) formulations, formulation agents for suspension concentrate (SC) formulations, and formulation agents for capsule suspension (CS) formulations.\n\nEmbodiments include those wherein the second herbicide is selected from WSSA Group 9 herbicides, WSSA Group 13 herbicides, WSSA Group 15 herbicides, WSSA Group 27 herbicides, WSSA Group 10 herbicides, WSSA Group 22 herbicides, WSSA Group 7 herbicides, and WSSA Group 3 herbicides; including isomers and/or C\n\nOther embodiments include those wherein the second herbicide is selected from WSSA Group 14 triazolinone herbicides, WSSA Group 1 cyclohexanedione herbicides, WSSA Group 2 imidazolinone herbicides, WSSA Group 14 N-phenylphthalimide herbicides, WSSA Group 14 diphenylether herbicides, WSSA Group 14 pyrimidinedione herbicides and WSSA Group 5 1,2,4-triazine herbicides; including isomers and/or C\n\nStill other embodiments include those wherein the second herbicide is selected from metamifop, atrazine, fenoxaprop, fenoxaprop-ethyl, fenoxaprop-P, fenoxaprop-P-ethyl, 2,4-D (2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid), florasulam, halosulfuron, halosulfuron-methyl and prosulfocarb; including isomers and/or C\n\nMost preferred embodiments include those wherein the second herbicide is selected from sulfentrazone, pethoxamid, pyroxasulfone, metamifop, clomazone, glyphosate, 2-(2,4-dichlorophenyl)methyl-4,4-dimethyl-3-isoxazolidinone, 4-(4-Fluorophenyl)-6-(2-hydroxy-6-oxocyclohexane-1-carbonyl)-2-methyl-1,2,4-triazine-3,5(2H,4H)-dione, dimethenamid-P, acetochlor, isoxaflutole, mesotrione, topramezone, glufosinate, paraquat, linuron, metribuzin, clethodim, imazethapyr, flumioxazin, fomesafen, oxyfluorfen, saflufenacil, atrazine, fenoxaprop, fenoxaprop-ethyl, fenoxaprop-P, fenoxaprop-P-ethyl, 2,4-D, florasulam, halosulfuron, halosulfuron and prosulfocarb, including isomers and/or C\n\nIn another aspect, methods of controlling undesirable vegetation and protecting a crop are described using a herbicidal composition that contains a first herbicide beflubutamid, or an optically enriched form thereof, and at least one second herbicide (as further specified herein, and different from beflubutamid). The method of controlling undesired vegetation in a crop comprises applying to the locus of such vegetation a herbicidally effective amount of the herbicidal composition.\n\nThe herbicidal compositions defined herein as well as the herbicidal compositions used in the method defined herein may optionally also include one or more further herbicides.\n",

    "description": "\nThis application claims the benefit of Danish Application No. PA 2016 70699 filed Sep. 13, 2016 and PCT/DK2017/050286 filed Sep. 12, 2017, International Publication No. WO 2018/050187 A1, which are hereby incorporated by reference in their entirety as if fully set forth herein.\n\nInline cutting system for an extruded string of meat analogue product, method for inline cutting an extruded string of meat analogue product and use of such inline cutting system\n\n\nFIELD OF THE INVENTION\n\n\nThe present invention relates to an inline cutting system comprising an extruder having an outlet, an outlet line connected with the extruder outlet, wherein the outlet line comprises a side wall surrounding an internal passage and cutting means arranged in connection with the outlet line, wherein said extruder is arranged for continuously producing a meat analogue product and wherein the extruded string of meat analogue product after leaving the extruder is cut into meat pieces by the cutting means.\n\nFurthermore the invention relates to a method for inline cutting an extruded string of meat analogue product, which method comprises the steps of\n\n\nThe inline cutting system is used for cutting meat analogue products into meat pieces by the cutting means in a continuous process, where the cutting means is arranged after an extruder and where the extruder and the outlet line forms a closed enclosure upstream of the cutting means.\n\nThe extruder comprises a product inlet and a product outlet and a rotor arranged coaxially inside an extruder barrel and said product outlet is connected to the outlet line.\n\nThe extruder may furthermore comprise heating means. Such heating means may be understood as means for applying heat to the product produced in the extruder, but it could also be understood as means for regulating the temperature of the product either to a higher or lower temperature. Said heating means may thus be construed as heat applying or heat extracting means or a combination thereof.\n\nA mixing housing can be arranged directly in front of the barrel or even in the inlet end of the barrel. The emulsionâthe productâwill be mixed here and there may be added ingredients of any kind in this part of the process.\n\nThe extruder may also be suitable for other purposes than making a meat analogue product e.g. for making confectionery or any other type of feed- or foodstuff.\n\nThe productâe.g. an emulsionâmay be supplied to the extruder and pressed into the product inlet by a pump of suitable type, or by a suitable feeding apparatus, and may alternatively be assisted by the rotor comprising scraping means. If the rotor comprises some kind of helical conveyor means and if the rotor is rotated relatively in a forward direction, the product willâat leastâbe assisted through the extruder.\n\nThe expression âmeat analogue productâ as used in the present application covers a product made from meat, a product made from ingredients not being meat or a combination hereof.\n\nWhen using meat then it is important that the product after leaving the extruder is cut into pieces which have a more natural and less artificial look compared to the known cutting systems. Accordingly one could say that âanalogueâ rather means ânaturally lookingâ.\n\nWhen using a product made from ingredients not being meat one could say that the expression is used in a more âtraditionalâ understanding as a meat alternative product which after leaving the extruder is cut into pieces having a natural look as a piece of meat.\n\n\nBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION\n\n\nBefore the development of the present invention, it has been known to use various rotating cutters where the product in a process after extrusion are cut and guided onto an open conveyor and to further processing such as e.g. cooling and packaging.\n\nAlso a cutting device known as a âdicerâ is commonly used. In a dicer the product may be cut into slices and also into dices. This type of machinery is supplied with product into a feed hopper and further into a rotating impeller. The product is thus processes in a rather open process allowing cooling and aeration of the product to take place. Especially aeration is typically unwanted due to hygienic issues.\n\nAlso other types of cutting equipment are known. Common to all the known cutting equipment is that it will cut e.g. an extruded product into very uniform shapes. Producing very uniform products may be a specific demand for some types of products. However for other products such as meat analogue products there is a very large demand for non-uniform products. This is especially important as some products may look too âartificialâ when cut into very uniform shapes using the known methods and machinery.\n\nThe known cutting techniques are used in many applications all over the world where feed- and foodstuffs are produced from a large variety of e.g. proteins and fats and combined into a preferred product having a structure very similar to meat.\n\nThe known techniques are used in many applications all over the world with the advantage that feed- and foodstuffs can be produced form a large variety of e.g. proteins and fats and combined into a preferred product having e.g. a structure very similar to meat or other feed- and foodstuff products.\n\nOne challenge by using the known technique is that the machinery, such as the cutting means, over time has a tendency to accumulate layers of product that attaches onto the surface of the parts of the cutting means. Such deposits are built up due to the friction in such equipment and heat generated from shear in the cutting means and thus the emulsion attaches onto the heated surfaces. Also the heat contribution from the extruder has an influence on the tendency for the product to attach onto the surface of the conveyor as well as of the barrel.\n\nOne drawback is that a time consuming cleaning has to take place on a regular basis, and that the building up of such deposits, no matter what, has at least some damaging influence on the uniformity of the product when it leaves the cutting means as the cutting process is influenced by the deposits on the cutting means.\n\nThe cutting system cuts the product into smaller pieces of a suitable size. The size given the product at this stage may be the final size of the product, but it may also be an intermediate size where the product will be processed even more at a later stage. It is a desire that the product could be given the final size in an inline cutting system in order to overcome need of handling and later processing in order to give the product a structure very similar to meat or other feed- and foodstuff products.\n\n\nOBJECT OF THE INVENTION\n\n\nThe object of this invention is to provide a system comprising cutting means for inline cutting a string of extruded meat analogue product in a closed process and where the at least one cutting means is arranged to cut the product in longitudinal direction of the string in a continuous process after extrusion.\n\nA further object of the invention is to provide a method for cutting an extruded meat analogue product in longitudinal direction of the string, in a closed process and in a continuous manner after extrusion.\n\nA further object is to provide a system and a method for cutting in the transversal direction of the string of meat analogue product at the outlet opening of the outlet line, in a closed process and in a continuous manner after extrusion.\n\nA further object is to provide a system and a method of meat analogue product in which the cutting means is easy to clean.\n\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION\n\n\nThe object of the invention is obtained with a system mentioned above and being peculiar in that said cutting means are extending through the side wall of the outlet line and extends inside said internal passage, that the cutting means comprises at least one cutting edge which is pointed in a substantial axial direction of the outlet line in order to establish a cutting in the longitudinal direction of the string of meat analogue product and that the extruder and the outlet line forms a closed enclosure upstream of the cutting means.\n\nThe method according to the invention is peculiar in that the method further comprises the steps of\n\n\nThe use of the inline cutting system according to the invention for cutting meat analogue products into meat pieces by the cutting means in a continuous process, where the cutting means is arranged after an extruder involves that the extruder and the outlet line forms a closed enclosure upstream of the cutting means.\n\nThe longitudinal direction of the string will be orientated in the axial direction of the of the outlet line. At least the outer part of the outlet line close to the opening will be a straight and rigid part. At last this outer part of the outlet line will be of metal, e.g. stainless steel.\n\nCutting means can be constituted by any type of means and may possibly be a steel wire or a regular knife comprising a blade and an edge as mentioned below.\n\nNo matter how the cutting means is constructed the cutting according to the invention is done in an axial manner along the direction of the product flow. This axial cutting is combined with a cutting in the transversal direction in order to cut the string into meat pieces.\n\nThe product will typically be produced using a helix shaped rotor and will thus have a flat shape comparable to the shape of a belt, meaning that the product has a band or strap shapeâlong and wider than thick.\n\nWhen the product is extruded this shape is created and when the product enters the outlet line a number of these âbeltsâ are compressed and by performing axial cuts of the product in the outlet line the product obtains a more natural and less artificial look compared to the known cutting systems.\n\nThe outlet line may have an external and/or internal passage having a cross sectional shape being circular, oval, square, rectangular or any other shape.\n\nThe cutting means which extend through an opening in the side wall could go all the way through the side wall and extend through a diametrally opposite opening. However, it is preferred that the cutting means extend through an opening in the side wall and extend through the internal passage to a position immediate vicinity of the inner side of the side wall opposite the opening.\n\nThe cutting means effect a cutting in the longitudinal direction of the string which could be orientated through the internal passage in a laminar way or could be forwarded through the internal passage of the outlet line with a screw-like rotation. The cutting action would obtain very natural like surface of the final meat pieces.\n\nSeeing that the cutting is effected in a closed system, a very efficient handling of the product is obtained in which it is possible to control the different parameters. Moreover, there will be no risk of contamination or any need for aligning meat pieces which is the case with a treatment according to prior art.\n\nMoreover, the process is efficient seeing that the cutting is effected continuously in the extruded string of the meat analogue product.\n\nIn order to establish meat pieces it might the string parts formed by the cutting in axial direction are also cut into individual lengths with a cutting edge orientated transversal to the outlet line.\n\nWhen operating the system the cutting edge which establishes the cutting in the transversal direction of the string will be reciprocating movement with a high frequency. Typically the frequency could be more strokes/cuttings per second, e.g. 4-10 strokes/sec. However, it is noted that the frequency of the reciprocating movement of the cutting edge on the transversal cutting is adapted to the flow rate through the outlet line.\n\nAccording to a further embodiment, the system according to the invention is peculiar in that the cutting means comprises at least one cutting edge which is pointed in a direction substantial perpendicular to the outlet line in order to establish a cutting in the transversal direction of the string of meat analogue product.\n\nIt should be observed that the cutting edge described could be arranged with a straight extension or any curved extension. Moreover, the cutting edge could be arranged with an oblique orientation compared to a plane being perpendicular to the axial direction of the outlet line. Likewise the cutting edge could be orientated with an extension in a plane being perpendicular to the axial direction of the rigid pipe.\n\nAccording to a further embodiment, the system according to the invention is peculiar in that the cutting means is arranged in at least one side opening in the side wall which closely surrounds the cutting means.\n\nWhen the cutting means are arranged through side openings in the side wall it is possible to retract the cutting means from the position where they are arranged in the internal passage of the outlet line to a position outside or partly outside the side wall. When the side opening which is used for the retraction and reinserting of the cutting means closely surrounds the cutting means it is possible to obtain a scraping effect. Hereby the cutting edge could be cleaned on regular basis.\n\nRetracting and inserting a cutting edge is effected very quickly. A cycle will only take parts of a second in order to obtain an axial cutting which is substantially continuously. When the cutting edge is used in the meat analogue product the deposits which are build up on the cutting edge is automatically removed by the scraping action of the side openings which closely surrounds the cutting means.\n\nMoreover, the closely surrounding opening will ensure that the process would be a closed process. As mentioned above a closed process is important due to hygienic issues, e.g. to obviate aeration of the product.\n\nAccording to a further embodiment, the system according to the invention is peculiar in that the cutting means is connected with drive means for retracting the cutting means from their position in the internal passage and reinserting the cutting means again whereby a scraping effect is obtained when retracting the cutting means.\n\nAs mentioned above drive means are used for the retraction and reinserting of the cutting means. The drive means could have different forms.\n\nIt is preferred to use fast acting piston cylinder mechanism which is connected either directly with the cutting means or indirectly through support beams if more cutting means are actuated simultaneously.\n\nThe movement of the cutting means or the support beam will be controlled by guide means which ensures a correct linear movement of the cutting means during the retraction and the reinsertion.\n\nAccording to a further embodiment, the system according to the invention is peculiar in that the cutting means comprises at least one knife set, that each knife comprises a blade and said cutting edge.\n\nA knife is suitable to act as cutting means. A knife would comprise a blade and the cutting edge which effects the cutting of the string. At least one knife set is used. However, more knife sets would normally be used in order to obtain the actually cutting of the string under different angles. When using more knife sets arranged under different angles it is possible to divide the string into any desired number of partial strings. The number of knife sets would be adapted to the diameter of the internal passage and the intended size of the final meat pieces.\n\nAccording to a further embodiment, the system according to the invention is peculiar in that said at least one knife set comprising two, three or more knife blades arranged in relation to each other e.g. in parallel.\n\nA knife set could comprise two, three or more knife blades arranged parallel. Hereby it is possible with only one actuator or drive mechanism to effect more axial cuttings in different planes having the same angle instead of using more knife set which each comprises only one knife blade with cutting edge.\n\nAccording to a further embodiment, the system according to the invention is peculiar in that the cutting means comprises at least two sets of cutting edges, that each set of cutting edges is arranged in a plane substantially perpendicular to the outlet line, that said at least two sets of cutting edges are arranged in different positions at the circumference of the outlet line for retraction under different angles.\n\nAs mentioned earlier two sets of cutting edges could be arranged under different angles relating to the outlet line. When the cutting edges are arranged at different positions at the circumference the mutual angle between the planes in which the cutting edge acts could be provided by any suitable positioning of the side openings in the side wall of the outlet line. The cutting edges will provide a cutting in the axial direction of the outlet line. By adjustment of the mutual angles of the cutting edges it is possible to obtain the form of the partial string formed by the cutting action.\n\nAccording to a further embodiment, the system according to the invention is peculiar in that the cutting means comprises at least one further cutting edge which is pointed in a direction substantial perpendicular to the outlet line and being arranged at the outlet opening of the outlet line in order to establish a cutting in the transversal direction of the string of meat analogue product leaving the outlet line.\n\nThe further cutting edge arranged at the opening of the outlet line could be used instead of the cutting means providing the transversal cutting of the partial strings effected inside the outlet line. The cutting edge acting at the outlet opening of the outlet line could also be used in combination with a transversal cutting already effected in the outlet line.\n\nThe cutting means arranged at the opening of the outlet line could be given different forms and a higher degree of freedom is obtained in the embodiment of such cutting means than it is possible to obtain with cutting means extending through an opening in the side wall in order to establish the cutting in the transversal direction of the string.\n\nAccording to a further embodiment, the system according to the invention is peculiar in that hat the at least one further cutting edge is a rotating cutting edge rotating around and axis perpendicular to the outlet line.\n\nThe further cutting edge at the outlet opening could have a reciprocal movement. However, it is preferred that the cutting edge is a rotating cutting edge which rotates around an axis perpendicular to the outlet line. With such rotation or movement it is possible to adapt the rotational speed and thereby influence the size of the final meat pieces obtained in the cutting. Moreover, the rotation or movement could be used to direct the meat pieces leaving the outlet opening in any desired direction by adjusting the position of the rotation axis for the rotating cutting edge.\n\nAccording to a further embodiment, the system according to the invention is peculiar in that the at least one further cutting edge cooperates with the edge of the opening of the outlet line which acts as a wearing bar for the cutting edge.\n\nWhen using the further cutting edge it is possible that the edge of the opening of the outlet line could act as a wearing bar or counter knife for the cutting edge. Hereby it is possible in an efficient way to establish the cutting.\n\nAccording to a further embodiment, the system according to the invention is peculiar in that the at least one further cutting edge is a shredding edge in order to obtain a shredding rather than a clean cutting.\n\nWhen a shredding edge is used for the further cutting edge a shredding could be obtained which would give the final meat piece a more natural look.\n\nAccording to a further embodiment, the system according to the invention is peculiar in that the outlet line comprises a flexible hose which at one end is connected with the extruder outlet and at the other end is connected with a straight rigid pipe at which the cutting means is provided.\n\nThe outlet line needs not to be in a single piece. When using a flexible hose connected with the extruder outlet and being connected with a straight rigid pipe it is possible to have a flexible positioning of the cutting means in relation to an extruder.\n\nAccording to a further embodiment, the system according to the invention is peculiar in that the cutting system comprises two or more outlet lines each of which is connected with an extruder outlet.\n\nWhen the cutting system comprises to a more outlet lines it is possible to provide all the rigid pipes with the opening of the outlet lines on a common line cooperating with a rotating cutting edge arranged as a single element instead of using more rotating cutting edges which should each have a drive system. Moreover, it is possible to adapt the capacity seeing that one could use a number of the extruders or all of the extruders which are associated with the outlet lines.\n\nAccording to a further embodiment, the method according to the invention is peculiar in\n\n\nAs already mentioned the closed process is beneficial and the process should preferably be continuously. By retracting the cutting means and establishing a scraping effect it is possible to obtain a cutting effect seeing that the retraction and reinsertion of the cutting means could be effected with such a speed that the extruder needs not to be stopped during this movement of the cutting means.\n\nAccording to a further embodiment, the method according to the invention is peculiar in\n\n\nWhen the further cutting edge pointed in the direction substantially perpendicular to the outlet line then the further cutting in transversal direction of the string is effected when the meat analogue product leaves the outlet line. Such transversal cutting at the opening of the outlet line gives a freedom for the frequency of the cutting and also the form of the cutting.\n\nAccording to a further embodiment, the method according to the invention is peculiar in\n\n\nWhen tearing or shredding is effected the final meat pieces will not look artificial and be more like a natural meat product.\n\nThe main benefit of all of the above mentioned embodiments is that the process is effected continuously and in a closed system. Therefore, the final string of meat analogue product is cut into the final form of meat pieces without any risk of aeration which is unwanted due to hygienic issues.\n\nMoreover, the continuously working process could easily be adapted as an inline process where the cutting system is coupled directly to the outlet of an extruder.\n\nA further advantage is the possibility to clean the cutting means through a CIP cleaning procedure.\n\nAdvantageously, the cutting system could cut the products into the final size of the product in order to obviate the need to process the meat pieces leaving the cutting means at a later stage.\n",

    "description": "\n\nFIELD OF THE INVENTION\n\n\nThe present invention relates to low moisture blocks used to deliver feed supplements and other ingestible substances to animals.\n\n\nBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION\n\n\nLow moisture feed blocks for animals made by dehydrating molasses and adding special nutritional elements and other ingredients have become widely used. Such blocks are generally highly palatable and thus attract animals, permitting them to serve as a delivery vehicle for feed supplements or other feed elements provided on an ad libitum consumption basis. They also have a consumption limiting feature, in that they generally must be consumed by licking, rather than in bites, which slows ingestion. The combination of attraction and slow consumption also helps to hold grazing animals in locations near the blocks. See, e.g., U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,244,217; 6,390,024 and 6,561,133.\n\nAs a result of these qualities, low moisture blocks have become widely used in many animal feed situations with many different ingredient formulations. However, it has been noted, particularly in warmer climates, that low moisture blocks tend to exhibit cold flow properties. That is, although they are for most purposes a solid, relatively hard mass, stable in shape and able to withstand rain, at warmer ambient temperatures gravity causes them to tend to slump slowly. When the block material is within an upright container (as is usually the case), and it simply slumps to conform further to the container, the cold flow has little or no noticeable effect. However, if a low moisture block container is tipped or torn (as can happen when large animals interact with it) or if it is biodegradable and partially breaks down or if the block is deployed without a container, the cold flow property will cause the block material to slump into a flattened pile or puddle within about 48 hours of exposure to an air temperature, or direct sunlight causing a block surface temperature, over 85 degrees F., which is typical in summer time of many parts of the U.S. The block behaves like water seeking its own level, albeit so slowly the slumping seems imperceptible. For situations where the low moisture block is to be consumed over a longer period and slumping will occur to an undesirable degree before complete consumption, resistance to cold flow would be highly desirable.\n\n\nBRIEF SUMMARY OF THE DISCLOSURE\n\n\nThis discloses a method for forming a low moisture block with cold flow resistance. The method comprises subjecting a feed mixture containing molasses-like liquids to mixing to form a homogenous mixture; dehydrating the molasses-like mixture to less than about 2.0% moisture using heating; adding to the dehydrated molasses-like liquid mixture one or more feed ingredients in dry ingredient form, comprising 10% to 50% by weight of the resulting mixture; adding to the dehydrated molasses-like mixture a composition comprising at least one of CaO, reactive MgO, ZnO, MnO, FeO, CuO, CuO\n\nThis discloses a low moisture block formulation with resistance to cold flow comprising a molasses-like mixture dehydrated to less than 2% by weight water; dry feed ingredients, mixed with the dehydrated molasses-like mixture and comprising 10% to 50% by weight of the resulting mixture of dehydrated molasses-like mixture and dry ingredients; and a composition comprising at least one of CaO, reactive MgO, ZnO, MnO, FeO, CuO, CuO\n",

    "description": "\nThis application is a divisional of application Ser. No. 15/305,175 filed on Oct. 19, 2016, Now Abandon\n\n\nFIELD OF APPLICATION\n\n\nThe present invention relates to the technical area of the food industry and relates, in particular, to a ready-to-eat shelf-stable packaged focaccia. The present invention also relates to a process for the production of a ready-to-eat shelf-stable packaged focaccia.\n\n\nPRIOR ART\n\n\nFocaccia is a typical Italian bakery product obtained from the processing of a dough of soft wheat flour, water, extra virgin olive oil, yeast and salt, which is leavened and subsequently baked in an oven in an iron baking tray having a very low edge. The focaccia usually has a rectangular shape but can also be circular in shape.\n\nAccording to some recipes, the focaccia can also be flavoured with various ingredients, more traditionally onions, tomatoes, olives, rosemary, cheese and/or other ingredients, according to taste, which are incorporated in the kneading and/or lamination steps and/or placed on the surface of the focaccia.\n\nThe focaccia is different from bread in that it is substantially flat, of small thickness (in general the thickness does not exceed two-three centimetres) and with an upper surface that is slightly oily and golden brown in colour. The upper surface typically exhibits a plurality of blind holes (or dimples) arranged more or less regularly over the entire surface. Typically, these holes are characterised in that they are more browned (therefore darker) on the surface and lighter at the base and in that they contain traces of oil.\n\nThe traditional focaccia is also characterised in that, upon tasting, a contrast of flavour is perceived between the areas in which the surface is higher in salt and those in which it is poorer in salt, a contrast created by the presence on the surface of grains of salt, which confers an uneven salting of the surface.\n\nFocaccia is a food which is traditionally eaten not only as a main dish but, depending on the portion, also as a snack between meals.\n\nProcesses for the preparation of fresh focaccia have long been known.\n\nThe dough for a plain fresh focaccia comprises usually soft wheat flour, water, extra virgin olive oil, yeast and salt. After mixing of the ingredients together, the dough ball is left to rest for at least 30 minutes at a temperature of 30-35Â° C. The dough is then flattened out (optionally after a lamination and/or filling step) on a baking tray previously oiled with extra virgin olive oil and is brushed with oil on the surface of the dough. The surface is then scattered with coarse salt and the dough is then pressed with the fingertips, obtaining blind holes. The dough is then again leavened and finally the baking tray is placed in the oven at 200-230Â° C. for 9-15 minutes.\n\nOf course, there are many variations to this process which can comprise further leavening periods, with different times and temperatures and with different times and temperatures of baking. There is also a wide variability in the choice of the quantities of the ingredients and of the seasoning or filling.\n\nFresh focaccia, according to the adopted process, may be variably thick, crispy, browned, filled/seasoned and salted, according to taste. The aforesaid holes, typical of focaccia, may also be more or less visible, depending on the adopted process.\n\nOne characteristic of fresh focaccia is the fact that its shelf life, generally, is not longer than 24 hours. Already a few hours after coming out of the oven, in fact, the focaccia undergoes a gradual migration of the humidity which reduces its fragrance and makes the structure chewy (and subsequently dry). Moreover the oil undergoes a deterioration in quality which causes a loss of fragrance. This type of focaccia is therefore suitable for being sold and served only fresh, either hot or cold.\n\nOf course, this imposes a limit in that it has to be purchased or prepared only a few hours prior to consumption.\n\nIn an attempt to overcome this limit, and make available a longer-lasting focaccia, which can be purchased days, even months, before its consumption, the food industry has devised various solutions, such as for example that of making available, both for catering and for sale in supermarkets, half-baked focaccias, packaged in modified atmosphere and refrigerated or frozen baked or half-baked focaccias.\n\nIn the case of the refrigerated or frozen product, the prolonged freshness over time is obviously guaranteed by the low storage temperatures. On the other hand, in the case of the half-baked product stored for example in modified atmosphere, or under vacuum, the preservation at ambient temperature of the focaccia is guaranteed by the very modified atmosphere (or vacuum) and it can therefore be stored at ambient temperature.\n\nThese products mentioned above have the advantage of allowing the consumer to purchase and store the focaccia at home also for long periods of time prior to its consumption, so as to have it available when needed.\n\nHowever these products require a baking step or at least a defrosting/heating step by the consumer or caterer, to complete their preparation, shortly before consumption. Once this latter step of preparation has been completed, in fact, the focaccia will have a keeping time comparable to that of a fresh focaccia.\n\nAs a consequence, these products impose yet another limitation with respect to the convenience of being able to have at one's disposal a focaccia ready for consumption at any time, in particular when an equipped kitchen is not available, for example in a work environment or when travelling.\n\nFrom the database GNPD [Online] MINTEL (database accession number 2144781; August 2013) it is known a âgarlic focaccia breadâ, produced by the Australian company Quattro's Bakehouse & Fine Foods, which is âsuitable for preparing snacks or for lunches, and can be sliced, filled and toastedâ. This product must be stored in a chilled condition and thus is not shelf-stable.\n\nThe database GNPD [Online] MINTEL (database accession number 321662; December 2004) discloses âFocaccia Rollsâ, which are described as âdelicious Italian style white soft bread made with extra virgin olive oil (3.5% b.w.) and topped with oreganoâ. This product, due to its low content of extra virgin olive oil and also to its low overall content of fats (9.4% b.w.), cannot be considered as comparable to a traditional, fresh âfocacciaâ. Moreover, this product contains 4% b.w. of sugars, whereas traditional focaccia does not contain sugars.\n\nThe need is therefore felt to make available a shelf-stable focaccia at ambient temperature, that is ready to eat, which has optimal appearance and organoleptic qualities, comparable to those of a fresh focaccia.\n\nThe technical problem at the basis of the present invention is therefore that of making available a packaged focaccia having the appearance and organoleptic qualities comparable to those of a fresh focaccia, which has long shelf life at ambient temperature, and which at the same time is ready to eat, i.e. does not need any treatment in order to finish off its preparation prior to consumption.\n\n\nSUMMARY OF THE INVENTION\n\n\nThe technical problem disclosed above has therefore been solved by making available a packaged shelf-stable ready-to-eat focaccia, having appearance and organoleptic qualities comparable to those of a fresh focaccia, which contains extra virgin olive oil in a quantity of at least 6% by weight based on the final weight of the focaccia and exhibits a relative humidity comprised between 25 and 32%, preferably comprised between 26% and 29%, more preferably 27%, and water activity (a\n\nThe focaccia of the invention is substantially flat in appearance, with a substantially level upper surface which exhibits blind holes (also referred to as dimples or wells) distributed substantially homogenously on the surface of the focaccia, preferably at a distance of approximately 2 cm from each other, and with a continuous base.\n\nPreferably the depth of the aforesaid holes is at least 70%, more preferably at least 90%, even more preferably at least 95% of the thickness of the focaccia.\n\nPreferably the thickness of the focaccia is comprised between 15 and 35 mm with holes of depth comprised between 10 and 33 mm.\n\nPreferably the aforesaid holes exhibit traces of salt and/or oil inside.\n\nThe upper surface of the focaccia appears preferably lightly oily.\n\nAdvantageously in the focaccia of the present invention, relative humidity and water activity are substantially homogeneous across the focaccia. That is to say that, for example, the focaccia of the invention does not exhibit a crispy surface, or having the edges crispier than the centre.\n\nPreferably the focaccia comprises, by weight based on the final weight of the focaccia, flour in a quantity comprised between 50 and 60%, preferably comprised between 53 and 58%, more preferably about 56%; vegetable fats and/or oils and/or fractions thereof in a quantity comprised between 12 and 20%, preferably about 17%, of which extra virgin olive oil in a quantity comprised between 6 and 10%, preferably about 9%; yeast in a quantity comprised between 2 and 4%, preferably about 3%; salt in a quantity comprised between 1.0 and 2.3%, preferably about 2%, at least one organoleptically characterising ingredient in a quantity comprised between 0 and 15%; at least one baking processing aid in a quantity comprised between 0 and 0.1%; at least one emulsifier in a quantity comprised between 0 and 0.8%; and dietary fibres in a quantity comprised between 0 and 1.5%.\n\nThis flour can be selected from any cereal flour, preferably in the group consisting of durum wheat, soft wheat, turanicum wheat (\n\nPreferably such vegetable fats and/or oils and/or fractions thereof are selected in the group consisting of palm, olive, sunflower, high oleic sunflower, canola oils and/or fats, and combinations thereof, more preferably a mixture of extra virgin olive oil and palm fat and/or vegetable margarine.\n\nPreferably the focaccia of the present invention comprises a quantity of extra virgin olive oil comprised between 6 and 10% and a quantity of palm fat and/or vegetable margarine comprised between 6 and 10%.\n\nPreferably the focaccia of the present invention comprises 9% of extra virgin olive oil and 8% of palm fat and/or vegetable margarine.\n\nPreferably the yeast is natural yeast, more preferably natural yeast and natural yeast starter, the latter being preferably powdered. The latter in fact contributes to conferring to the focaccia of the invention a better taste.\n\nPreferably the organoleptically characterising ingredient, if present, is present in a quantity comprised between 5 and 15%.\n\nThe optional presence of processing aid, emulsifiers and/or dietary fibres has the purpose of contributing to the preservation of the softness of the focaccia during its storage.\n\nThe baking processing aid is preferably present in a quantity comprised between 0.02 and 0.1%, the emulsifier is present in a quantity comprised between 0.2 and 0.8% and the dietary fibres are present in a quantity comprised between 0.5 and 1.5%.\n\nThe baking processing aid is preferably an ascorbic acid and/or enzyme-based baking improver.\n\nThe emulsifier is preferably chosen from among fatty acid mono- and diglycerides and/or lecithin.\n\nThe dietary fibres are preferably chosen in the group consisting of guar fibres, wheat fibres, sugar beet fibres, or combinations thereof, preferably guar fibres. The presence of the dietary fibres enables in fact to obtain a dough with relatively high water content without jeopardising the rheology of the dough itself.\n\nThe organoleptically characterising ingredient is preferably found in the focaccia according to the invention in one or a combination of the following ways: substantially homogenously distributed both on the surface and in the entire thickness of the focaccia, placed mainly inside the focaccia, and/or placed on the upper surface of the focaccia.\n\nAccording to a first preferred embodiment the focaccia consists, by weight based on the final weight of the focaccia, of flour in a quantity comprised between 50 and 60%, preferably comprised between 53 and 58%, more preferably about 56%; vegetable fats and/or oils and/or fractions thereof in a quantity comprised between 12 and 20%, preferably about 17%, of which extra virgin olive oil in a quantity comprised between 6 and 10%, preferably about 9%; yeast in a quantity comprised between 2 and 4%, preferably about 3%; salt in a quantity comprised between 1.0 and 2.3%, preferably about 2%; at least one baking processing aid in a quantity comprised between 0% and 0.1%; at least one emulsifier in a quantity comprised between 0 and 0.8%; dietary fibres in a quantity comprised between 0 and 1.5%; and water to 100%.\n\nIn this first embodiment the focaccia is referred to as plain, and with this term it is meant that there is no organoleptically characterising ingredient as defined here.\n\nAccording to a second preferred embodiment, the focaccia comprises one or more organoleptically characterising ingredients substantially homogeneously distributed both on the surface and in its entire thickness in a quantity comprised between 5 and 15%, preferably 8-13%, more preferably about 11% by weight based on the total weight of the dough.\n\nThis organoleptically characterising ingredient is preferably olives, more preferably stoned and fragmented black olives.\n\nAccording to a third preferred embodiment, the focaccia comprises one or more organoleptically characterising ingredients placed mainly inside the focaccia, in a quantity comprised between 5 and 15%, preferably 7-10%, more preferably about 8% by weight based on the total weight of the dough.\n\nThis organoleptically characterising ingredient is preferably tomato, more preferably osmotically dehydrated and fragmented cherry tomato.\n\nIn the second and third embodiments the focaccia is referred to as flavoured.\n\nOptionally the flavoured focaccias of the invention also contemplate the presence of at least one organoleptically characterising ingredient on the upper surface of the focaccia.\n\nIn the present invention the term organoleptically characterising ingredient refers to an ingredient characterising the taste and the appearance of the finished focaccia.\n\nThe organoleptically characterising ingredient is preferably chosen in the group consisting of vegetables, fruits, spices and aromatic herbs, cheeses, meats, fish, cereal grains or combinations thereof.\n\nExamples of organoleptically characterising ingredients are vegetables, such as olives, tomatoes, peppers, onions, aubergines, courgettes, capers; herbs and spices such as rosemary, basil, parsley, chilli pepper; cheese; meats such as ham, salami, lard, mortadella; fish such as anchovies, salmon; vegetable based sauces such as tomato sauce, pesto and similar preparations.\n\nThe upper surface of the focaccia has a golden-brown (hazelnut colour) appearance, lighter (white-ivory colour) inside the holes. The colour was measured by means of the photographic visual method, for example with digital photography with comparison method, as will be explained more clearly in the detailed description of the invention.\n\nThe focaccia is soft but not chewy.

In this case a flavoured focaccia is obtained.\n\nIn a third preferred embodiment the process does not comprise in step a) of kneading the presence of the at least one organoleptically characterising ingredient as defined here and comprises in step b) of extrusion and lamination of the dough a step of dosing of an organoleptically characterising ingredient between two sheets of dough. The organoleptically characterising ingredient of step b) is preferably tomato, more preferably osmotically dehydrated and fragmented cherry tomato. In this case also, a flavoured focaccia is obtained.\n\nThe term focaccia refers here to a bakery product obtained from the processing of a dough which comprises flour, water, vegetable oils and/or fats and/or fractions thereof, leavened and subsequently baked, which has a thickness of at least about 15 mm and which has an upper surface browned in colour with shaping holes having a depth of at least 50% of the thickness of the focaccia. Upon tasting, the focaccia exhibits a contrast in the perception of the salted flavour caused by the fact that the salt is not distributed over the upper surface continuously and homogenously.\n\nWith the expression âshelf-stableâ referred to the focaccia of the invention it is understood here that the packaged focaccia can be stored at ambient temperature for at least 60 days, preferably at least 90 days, even more preferably at least 120 days.\n\nWith the expression âready-to-eatâ referred to the focaccia of the invention it is understood here that the focaccia of the invention is ready to be eaten without the need for any preparation step such as for example defrosting or baking.\n\nThe expression âupper surfaceâ refers here to the surface which is exposed upwards during preparation and baking. The term surface, referred to the focaccia, refers here, again, to the upper surface, unless otherwise specified.\n\nThe focaccia of the present invention has a greater homogeneity of the content of water (or relative humidity) and value of water activity with respect to a fresh focaccia and of the prior art.\n\nIt was surprisingly found in fact that, thanks to this characteristic, but not only, the packaged focaccia of the present invention is able to sustain, unlike a fresh focaccia, a prolonged shelf life, at ambient temperature. More particularly, the focaccia of the present invention is preserved organoleptically and microbiologically for at least 60 days, preferably for 90 days, even more preferably for 120 days.\n\nThe step of filling the holes with saline solution, in particular, is crucial for the preservation, after the second leavening, of the holes obtained by the shaping performed following the first leavening.\n\nThe presence of olive oil in the shaping holes, as in the interior of the dough, in turn plays an important role in the control of the humidity of the product during baking and subsequently, by virtue of the result obtained, in the final product during its shelf life.\n\nIn addition to slowing down deterioration of the focaccia from the microbiological point of view, in fact, the high homogeneity of the humidity contributes to maintaining the focaccia soft, in every part thereof, throughout the aforesaid shelf-life, because the migration of the humidity, which is responsible for the deterioration of the texture of the traditional fresh focaccia, does not take place.\n\nUnlike other types of focaccias, in fact, the focaccia of the present invention has a soft and non-crispy upper surface.\n\nAnother factor which may contribute to the prolonging of the time of maintenance of the softness of the focaccia over time is the optional presence of the aforesaid processing aid and/or emulsifier(s) (such as for example fatty acid mono- and diglycerides).\n\nMoreover the particular profile of time, temperature and humidity adopted in the leavening steps c) and e), as well as the particular profile of time and temperature of the baking step g), have been optimised by the inventors to allow to obtain a focaccia having the desired consistency, humidity, flavour and appearance.\n\nIn the present invention, the process is such as to successfully obtain that the holes remain evident even after the leavening that follows the shaping, and after the subsequent baking of the focaccia. If a different sequence of steps of preparation of the focaccia and a different leavening profile were to be used, than those of the present invention, by omitting for example the step of filling of the holes with a saline solution, it could be that a leavening subsequent to the shaping would cause the swelling of the dough at the base of the holes, thus causing the loss of the holes themselves. In this case only small, barely visible holes would remain visible on the upper surface, which would not however confer the appearance of the typical focaccia which requires, instead, fully evident holes, with traces of oil. In this case moreover the perception of contrast between salty and less salty flavour typical of the focaccia would not be obtained because the saline solution would not be retained in the holes.\n\nOn the other hand, it would not be desirable to omit a leavening step subsequent to the shaping step because this would cause an excessive accumulation of dough at the holes, which would not be organoleptically acceptable.\n\nThe subsequent oiling of the upper surface, which ensures moreover the filling of the holes (the saline solution introduced previously will have been in fact absorbed following the second leavening, leaving the holes substantially empty) with oil, contributes to conferring a colour contrast between the browned surface of the focaccia and the lighter inside of the holes, and a desirable organoleptic effect because, as explained above, the presence of the saline solution first, and later of the oil, in the holes, contributes to the maintenance of an optimal distribution of the humidity in the focaccia during its preparation and during shelf-life, and upon tasting, a flavour contrast is experienced between the zones which comprise the holes, which are saltier, and those in which the hole is not present, which are less salty. The focaccia of the present invention therefore appears as a typical focaccia, with relatively deep holes, whiter in depth compared to the surface, and with traces of oil and saline solution in their inside.\n\nAdvantageously the focaccia of the present invention does not contain added sugars, usually used in the prior art for increasing the shelf life. The formulation of the present invention is in fact such that the desired preservation features are achieved without the need to resort to the addition of sugar. This is advantageous from the organoleptic point of view because, while it is known that sugar is a good preservative, it is also true that it gives an undesired taste to the focaccia.\n",

    "description": "\n\nFIELD OF THE INVENTION\n\n\nThe following relates to inhibiting growth of certain bacterium in coffee products. More particularly, the following relates to inhibiting \n\n\nBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION\n\n\nIced coffee has risen in popularity over the last decade. Iced coffee is standard hot brewed coffee that is chilled or served over ice.\n\nAn alternative to iced coffee is cold brew coffee. As compared to standard hot brewed coffee, cold brew coffee has a delicate flavor profile that is less acidic than hot brewed coffee. For this reason, some prefer cold brew coffee over hot brew coffee.\n\nRecently, nitrogen infused cold brew coffee products have become popular, especially in single use cans. Nitro cold brew (NCB) coffee is an emergent food trend for ground, roasted coffee beans filtered slowly (steeped) through a cold, room temperature, or hot-bloom water brewing process for 8 or more hours (upper range Ë36 hours). The beverage is stored anaerobically in cans or stainless steel kegs, and charged with nitrogen gas. The nitrogen gas infusion may be similar to the nitrogen widgets used for canned Guinness beer, and imparts small bubbles to the beverage which do not easily dissolve in water. This results in a creamy frothy head, imparting sweetness, less acidic taste and giving a fuller, thicker mouth feeling to NCB beverages when compared to regular coffee brews. Since the single use can product is relatively new, food safety requirements have been evolving.\n\nCold Brew Coffee spoilage is characterized by undesirable coffee characteristics identified as increasing acidity, off notes, and dull flavor which result in a souring over time that is accompanied by aroma changes which typically involve decreasing coffee aromas and eventually resulting sour aroma notes. Typical home brews may last 14-30 days in refrigeration, while industrial large-scale brewers are achieving about 90 days in cans and bottles in refrigerated storage conditions. However, 90 days shelf life for a commercial product limits its distribution channels and its availability in certain markets.\n\nRecently, it has been discovered that growth of certain bacterium can be a problem in these products. Particularly, \n\nThus, the existing guidelines that can be applied to a beverage include adding salt to a 3.5% salinity, producing a more acidic product (pH below 5.0), and heating the product in the packaging to 90Â° C. or higher for 10 minutes.\n\nAll of the foregoing, although capable of inhibiting \n\nFor example, heat can leave the cold brew coffee with a bitter and yeasty taste and a nitrogen dosed can has pressure limitations to the can due to the existing positive pressure already in that can at chilled temperatures. Salt is not an option as it would alter the flavor and, while it may be possible to increase the acidity, this has the downside of departing from the flavor profile that makes nitrogen infused cold brew coffee a popular product. Cold brew coffee typically has a pH range of 5.5-6.5 and since the pH scale is logarithmic, a significant amount of acid would need to be added to get the beverage below pH 5.0.\n\nUS 2017/0231245 discloses a ready-to-drink cold brew coffee product with a shelf life up to one year without refrigeration before consumption. However, the method of preparation involves heating a cold brewed mixture to a temperature of less than 100Â° C. for less than 1 minute to thereby form a pre-fill coffee composition. After heating, the method includes pouring and increasing a temperature of the pre-fill coffee composition to at least 82.2Â° C. and holding the coffee composition at the temperature of at least 82.2Â° C. for at least 30 seconds to form a filled coffee composition. As mentioned, this has the potential to affect the flavor profile of the cold brew. Moreover, the method does not address nitrogen dosing of the coffee.\n\nThe nitro coffee industry has generally believed that the addition of the nitrogen is not only important to provide for the gentle bubbled profile of the beverage but to also displace oxygen to inhibit growth of bacteriaâparticularly aerobic bacteria. Thus, the industry has generally tried to avoid oxygen within the canned coffee product. Oxygen also has another downside in that its presence generally limits shelf life in that the food processing industry often tries to remove oxygen in order to prolong shelf life.\n\nThus, both the food industry and the more niche nitro brew industry has sought to avoid oxygen. However, this lack of oxygen actually encourages \n\nMany of these problems also exist in hot brew coffee which is chilled and packaged. To solve the \n\nTherefore, there exists a need for a coffee product whether hot or cold brew coffee along with a processing method and system that inhibits \n\nThere further exists a need for methods of manufacturing coffee products and nitro coffee products, whether cold brewed, hot brewed, or iced, that inhibit \n\nThere exists a need for flavored coffee and nitro brew coffee that is shelf stable for greater than 90 days.\n\nThere exists a need for coffee products that are shelf stable for greater than 90 days.\n\n\nSUMMARY OF THE INVENTION\n\n\nTherefore, it is an object of the invention to supply a processing method that inhibits growth of \n\nIt is further an object of the invention to supply a processing method that produces coffee products including cold brew and/or nitro coffee products that are shelf stable for at least 180 days.\n\nIt is also an object of the invention to inhibit growth of \n\nIt is an object of the invention to supply a processing method that produces coffee products, including but not limited to cold brew coffee products, that are shelf stable for at least 180 days.\n\nIt is a further object of the invention to inhibit growth of \n\nIt is a further object of the invention to enable use of processing techniques which do not require the high temperatures associated with retort processing but still inhibit growth of \n\nYet another object of the invention is to provide a shelf stable low acid beverage (e.g. coffee) which is in a sealed container and contains flavorings such as milk, sweeteners etc but still maintains relatively low caloric content.\n\nâmilkâ as used herein refers to any type of milk whether animal or plant based, including but not limited to the examples described in the specification and âflavor additiveâ refers to a non-coffee based flavoring, including but not limited to the examples described in the specification.\n\nThese and other objects are achieved by provision of a method of manufacturing shelf stable nitro-cold brew coffee comprising dissolving oxygen into a liquid coffee product brewed at a temperature of less than 50Â° C.; dispensing nitrogen into the oxygenated coffee; and packaging said liquid coffee product with oxygen and nitrogen dissolved therein into a sealed container. The method produces product that is shelf stable at refrigerated conditions for at least 180 days.\n\nOther objects are achieved by providing a method of manufacturing shelf stable low acid beverages such as coffee or others where the coffee includes dissolved oxygen therein along with the addition of caloric additives such as milk, sweeteners or others. Preferably the caloric content is in the 0.5-9 calories per ounce range or possibly narrower range and most preferably high temperatures and particularly retort temperatures and processing is not used. By eliminating or not using high temperatures, a more gentle pasteurization can be used which results in the underlying flavor of the coffee not being destroyed by high temperature processing. Normally a high temperature treated coffee would require significantly more flavorings and sweeteners to overcome the damage caused by high temperature processing. Therefore the combined use of oxygen, the low acid beverage (e.g. coffee), and caloric additives in modest amounts (e.g. 0.5-9 calories/oz, 0.5-8, 0.5-7, 0.5-6, 0.5-5, 0.5-4, 0.5-3, 0.5-2 cal/oz) has been found to allow for both improved flavor, lower calories and longer shelf life with that improved flavor. The industry has historically believed that the addition of oxygen into the low acid beverage sealed container will ruin the flavor of these types of beverages, in contradiction to that belief, the inventors have discovered, somewhat unexpectedly, that use of oxygen actually allows for enhanced flavor along with non-cold chain transportation, however cold chain transportation can be used. The term calorie or cal refers to the unit of measure commonly found on US consumer nutrition labels which really is kilocalories or kcal. In some embodiments the can includes coffee, a milk product, carbohydrate sweetener, infused oxygen and without other additions to the beverage.

    "description": "\n\nFIELD OF THE INVENTION\n\n\nThe present invention relates to the transport of four-legged slaughter animal carcass or carcass parts hanging suspended from carriers engaging in openings in leg portions of the carcass or carcass parts. More particularly, it relates to the transfer of a carcass part from one carrier to another carrier.\n\n\nBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION\n\n\nIt is known to transport slaughter animal carcass parts hanging suspended from carriers engaging in openings in leg portions of the carcass parts. The carcass parts may be a half carcass that has been eviscerated and cleaned. The carriers used may be of the gambrel type, having two opposed carrier ends pointing away from each other and being tied together with a cross bar. The cross bar has a hanging arrangement that cooperates with an overhead transport conveyor system. Another type of carrier may be the Euro Hook variant, aka Euro Carrier, having a pointed end and a carrier portion shaped like a fishing carrier. The Euro Hook also has a hanging arrangement that cooperates with an overhead transport conveyor system similar to that used for gambrels. The single carriers may comply with DIN 5047 (Carriers for meat and other food; tubular track sliding carrier).\n\nFor example, EP1152664B1 (Butina APS) discloses transferring half pig carcasses hanging from each end of a gambrel engaging in first openings in the carcasses whereafter a suspension means, e.g. a single carrier, is attached to engage the calcaneal tendon, thus a second opening in the carcasses as is shown in \n\nWO2005/099459A1 (K.J. Maskinfabriken A/S) discloses transferring half carcasses, hanging from carriers of an overhead conveyor, to a horizontal conveyor belt by temporarily gripping and holding the carcass sides, cutting the sinews through and cutting the hind foot/toe to release the rest of the carcass onto the belt. This, and variations on this technology, is common in the industry, but has the disadvantage that the further deboning has to take place on a horizontal surface with heavy lifts for operators and limited opportunities for automation of processes.\n\n\nSUMMARY OF THE INVENTION\n\n\nOne object of the invention is to provide a system and a method for automatic transfer of carcass parts suspended from a first carrier to being suspended from a second carrier. The carcass parts may be a half carcass, e.g. from pig, that may have been eviscerated and cleaned. In this patent application, the term âcarcass partâ is also used for a whole animal carcass. The first carrier may be an industry standard gambrel having two opposed carrier ends pointing away from each other and being tied together with a cross bar or a single carrier, for example a Euro Hook. The second carrier may be a single carrier, for example a Euro Hook. With this system and method, it can be realised to transfer two carcass parts suspended from a gambrel to two single carriers that are either part of the same deboning line or where each single carrier is part of separate deboning lines. Similarly, a transfer of a carcass part from one single carrier to another single carrier may be realized, for example for classifying purposes or diversion to a cooling facility away from the current processing line.\n\nEmbodiments of the invention preferably seek to mitigate, alleviate or eliminate one or more of the above-mentioned disadvantages singly or in any combination. In particular, it may be seen as an object of embodiments of the present invention to provide an overhang rail system that solves the above-mentioned problems, or other problems, of the prior art.\n\nTo address one or more of these concerns, in a first aspect of the invention an overhang rail transport system is provided comprising a first carrier being transported by a first overhead conveyor in a transport direction and having a first carcass engaging portion, the first carrier being arranged to selectively carry a carcass part by engaging the carcass part with the first carcass engaging portion, a second carrier being transported by a second overhead conveyor and having a second carcass engaging portion, the second carrier being arranged to selectively carry a carcass part by engaging the carcass part with the second carcass engaging portion, a vertical aligning device to align the first carcass engaging portion and the second carcass engaging portion in a vertical direction, a horizontal aligning device to align the first carcass engaging portion and the second carcass engaging portion in a horizontal direction, so that both the first carcass engaging portion and the second carcass engaging portion simultaneously engage the carcass part, a tilting device to tilt the first carcass engaging portion downwards, so that the weight of the carcass part is gradually transferred from the first carcass engaging portion to the second carcass engaging portion, and a removing device to remove the first carcass engaging portion completely from engagement with the carcass part.\n\nThe overhang rail transport system may further comprise a first processing section having multiple spaced apart first carriers for conveying carcass parts of a four legged slaughter animal, where each of the first carriers has a free end designed to extend through an opening in a leg part of the carcass parts causing the carcass parts to be at least freely hanging, and at least one second processing section having multiple spaced apart second carriers where each of the second carriers has a free end designed to engage with the leg part of the carcass parts causing the carcass part to be at least freely hanging.\n\nThe overhang rail transport system may further have a transfer zone, positioned between the first processing section and the at least one second processing section, and a control device for automatically controlling the movement of the first and the second carriers so that upon arrival at the transfer zone the first and the second carriers are synchronized in movement such that the first carrier moves in a first direction carrying a carcass part through an opening arranged in the leg part and at least one empty second carrier moving in a second direction meet with their respective free ends facing each other. Multiple second processing sections may form corresponding multiple transfer zones of the overhang rail transport system, to direct carcass parts from the first carriers to selected second carriers of any of the multiple processing sections. In this way, carcass parts may be classified into different processing lines, for instance. The transfer zone is in one embodiment designed such that during movement of the first and the second carriers:\n\n\nThe at least one second processing section may include a second processing section comprising second type of carriers, a third processing section comprising third type of carriers etc., where each processing section may have different processing steps, e.g. one may be a first type of deboning line, another one may be a second type of deboning line, the third may be a cooling section acting as a buffer etc.\n\nIn one embodiment, the transfer zone is further designed so that upon arrival at the transfer zone the height level of the free end of the second carrier is below a height level of the free end of the first carrier such that the decrease in the relative position of the free ends causes the free end of the second carrier to penetrate into the opening at the leg part below the free end of the first carrier. Thus, a simple solution is provided to allow the first and the second carriers to engage with the carcass part via the opening in the leg part. The largest diameter or the height of the opening may vary but is commonly few centimeters. The difference in the height level is selected such that it is within the height of the opening.\n\nIn another embodiment, the transfer zone is further designed so the relative height level distance between the free end of the first carrier and the free end of the second carrier changes until the height level of the free end of the second carrier is above the height level of the first carrier causing the weight transfer of the carcass part load to the second carrier.\n\nIn one embodiment, the overhang rail system may further comprise a guiding device, subsequent to the transfer of the carcass part to the second carrier, to tilt the first carrier and guide the first carrier and/or the carcass part away from the second carrier resulting in that the second carrier being the sole carrier for the carcass part.\n\nIn one embodiment, the overhang rail system further may have a guiding device, subsequent to the transfer of the carcass part to the second carrier, to guide the first carrier and/or the carcass part away from the second carrier resulting in that the second carrier becomes the sole carrier for the carcass part.\n\nFurther, the guiding device may have an elongated guiding member arranged relative to the first and second carriers such that the elongated guiding member, e.g. a rod or similar, interacts with the first carrier and/or the carcass part while the first carrier moves in the first direction, the interaction forcing an increase in the relative horizontal distance between the first carrier and the second carrier until a complete separation of the first carrier from the opening in the leg part.\n\nThe first carrier may be slideably attached to a first rail guide and the second carrier may be slideably attached to a second rail guide, where the transfer zone is defined via the arrangement of the first and/or the second rail guide causing the change in the relative horizontal distance between the free end of the first carrier and of the free end of the second carrier, and causing the change in the relative height level distance between the free end of the first carrier and the free end of the second carrier.\n\nThe first carrier may be a gambrel like structure comprising free ends at its opposite ends, where each of the opposite ends carries a carcass part, where the at least one second processing section includes two second processing sections, where the synchronized movement occurs at the opposite ends of the gambrel where empty free ends of second carriers penetrate, e.g. simultaneously, into the respective opening at the leg parts of the carcass parts. Thus, it is now possible to automatically transfer the carcass parts, which may be half carcasses, to the second carriers associated with a second and third processing sections without any manual labour, where the processing steps at the second and third processing sections may include, but is not limited to, be cooling (temporal storage as an example), at least partly deboning of the carcass part by e.g. manual labour and/or processing devices.\n\nThe carcass part may initially be transferred from one side of the gambrel while the other side of the gambrel is temporarily supported by the second carrier.\n\nIn one embodiment, the overhang rail transport system further comprises guide arrangements comprising multiple of guides configured to stabilize and raise or lower one or more of the carcass engaging portions of the gambrel (free ends of the gambrel) during the movement of the gambrel in the transport direction.\n\nIn an embodiment, the guide arrangement comprises first bottom guide, generally shaped to follow a bottom contour of the gambrel, utilized for either stabilizing the gambrel from movement in a rotating direction about a conveying device to which the gambrel is slideably attached to and/or to raise one of the gambrel free ends in a vertical direction (and lower the opposite free end of the gambrel a corresponding distance).\n\nIn another embodiment, guide arrangement may further comprise a first top guide, to be used to stabilize the gambrel from movement in a rotating direction about the transport direction Similarly, a second top guide may be provided and configured to be used to stabilize the gambrel from movement in a rotating direction about the gambrel conveying device. Bottom guides may further be provided designed to have a profile in the travel direction of the gambrel. For example, the guide profile may be lower at an entrance portion of the guides and gradually be raised to a higher profile to push the gambrel upwards by tilting the gambrel backwards and upwards towards the gambrel conveying device. In this way, the vertical position of the free ends of the gambrel may be varied with respect to the conveying device depending upon where the gambrel is situated along the profile of the guides.\n\nThe first carrier may comprise a single hook, more specifically a Euro Hook. The single hook may comply with DIN 5047. In a further embodiment, the first carrier may be identical to the second carrier.\n\nAccordingly, an overhang rail system is provided that is capable of fully automatically performing a re-shackling of a carcass part from the first shackle type to the at least one second shackle type without any manual labour. The term carcass part may according to the present invention should be understood as, but not limited to, a half pig carcass. Moreover, the overhang rail system facilitates deboning and other processes since e.g. such a half pig can weigh well over 40 kg and will therefore be difficult to handle when the carcasses are lying on horizontal transport conveyors. A hanging carcass requires much less effort to manipulate by an operator. Moreover, the overall yield of the deboning may be increased significantly since e.g. no sawing operation is needed. Thus, as an example, the removal of the ribs e.g. in case the carcass part is half a pig, may be done manually so that the resulting ribs may contain the overall ribs from rib number 4 and onwards, i.e. a larger rib part, instead of where commonly, the removal of the ribs requires a sawing operations where from e.g. ribs number â throughout ribs 7-9 (as an example), which leaves sharp rib edges at the end of the ribs, and saw dust, which makes the resulting rib product less attractive towards customers and thus less valuable. Another example of an advantage of now being able to process (e.g. debone) such a half carcass is that the complete loin may be removed from the carcass part, commonly today, the middle part of the half carcass is removed via sawing operation from the leg part leaving a part of the loin in the leg part which is less valuable than the loin.\n\nFurther, such an automatic transfer of a carcass part from one carrier, belonging to one processing section, to another carrier, belonging to a second processing section, may be affected fully automatically which increases enormously the variety of the processing steps that may be chosen, by bypassing certain processing stations or choosing a certain processing line out of a selection of many processing lines for selected carcass parts.\n\nIn one embodiment, the transfer zone further comprises a support guide such as a tapered guide to interact with a rear side (i.e. the side that has no pointed end) of the first and/or the second shackle type while the second carrier engages with the carcass part and/or while the carcass part is removed from the first shackle and to the second shackle. This may e.g. be of relevance when the shackles are mounted to a rail system in a hinge like manner, thus, such support guide will prevent the shackle from swinging during the transfer of the carcass part.\n\nAccording to a second aspect a method is provided for transferring a carcass part from a first carrier to a second carrier, the first carrier being transported by a first overhead conveyor and having a first carcass engaging portion, the second carrier being transported by a second overhead conveyor and having a second carcass engaging portion, the method comprising the steps of:\n\n\nThe overhang rail system may further comprise:\n\n\nThe first direction and the second direction may in one embodiment be parallel directions where the shackles are moving in the same directions. In another embodiment, the shackles are moving in an angular direction relative to each other, e.g. with a 90 degrees angle.\n\nIn one embodiment, the second carrier is arranged to grip around a foot of the leg of the carcass part, where the second carrier comprises two free ends being more or less parallel, where the gripping around the food may include clamping the leg of the carcass part between these two free ends.\n\nIn one embodiment, the free end of each of the second carriers is configured to extend through an opening in the leg part of the carcass parts causing the carcass part to be at least freely hanging.\n\nIn one embodiment, the method comprises designing the transfer zone so that upon arrival at the transfer zone the height level of the free end of the second carrier is below a height level of the free end of the first carrier such that the decrease in the relative position of the free ends causes the free end of the second carrier to penetrate into the opening at the leg part below the free end of the first carrier.\n\nIn one embodiment, the method comprises further designing the transfer zone so the relative height level distance between the free end of the first carrier and the free end of the second carrier changes until the height level of the free end of the second carrier is above the height level of the first carrier causing the weight transfer of the carcass part load to the second carrier.\n\nIn one embodiment, the method further comprises the step of guiding the first carrier away from the second carrier using a guiding device, subsequent to the transfer of the carcass part to the second carrier, resulting in that the second carrier is the sole carrier for the carcass part.\n\nIn one embodiment, the method further comprises the step of increasing the relative horizontal distance between the first carrier and the second carrier until a complete separation of the first carrier from the opening in the leg part by interacting the guiding device in the shape of an elongated guiding member arranged relative to the first and second carriers such that the elongated guiding member interacts with the first carrier and/or the carcass part while the first carrier moves in the first direction, the interaction forcing an increase in the relative horizontal distance between the first carrier and the second carrier until a complete separation of the first carrier from the opening in the leg part.\n\nIn one embodiment, the method further comprises the step of using a gambrel like structure comprising free ends at its opposite ends as the first carrier, where each of the opposite ends carries a carcass part, wherein the at least one second processing section includes two second processing sections, wherein the synchronized movement occurs at the opposite ends of the gambrel where empty free ends of second carriers penetrate into the respective opening at the leg parts of the carcass parts.\n\nIn one embodiment, the step of transferring comprises transferring the carcass part from one side of the gambrel while the other side of the gambrel is temporarily supported by the second carrier.\n\nIn one embodiment, the first and the second carriers are identical.\n\nAccordingly, a method is provided that among other things allows fully automatization of re-shackling, e.g. from a gambrel to hooks while the carcass parts, e.g. half pig carcasses, are still hanging from an overhead position. This makes the subsequent processing much easier for an operator, e.g. deboning, trimming, compared to having carcasses lying on horizontal transport conveyors. Further, an automatic transfer of a carcass part from one carrier, belonging to one processing line, to another carrier, belonging to a second processing line, may be affected.\n",

    "description": "\n\nBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION\n\n\nThere is a growing need for efficient, high quality and low-cost plant-based high-protein food sources with acceptable taste, flavor and/or aroma profiles. However, it has proven difficult to achieve such products, particularly with low cost vegetarian protein sources.\n\nThe present inventors have previously disclosed a method to prepare a myceliated high-protein food product, which includes culturing a filamentous fungus in an aqueous media which has a high level of protein, for example at least 20% protein by dry weight (w/w) and at least 50 g/L protein. The fungi can include \n\nThere is also a need for processes for creating vegetarian and vegan products such as, alternative dairy alternative products, such as ice cream, yogurt, milk, pudding, cheese; ready to mix beverages and beverage bases for protein shakes and smoothies, dietary and nutritional beverages; extruded and extruded/puffed products, such as pasta noodles, crisps, and scoops, including breakfast cereals, sheeted baked goods such as tortillas, crackers, pizza crust; meat analogs and extenders, baked goods and baking mixes for breads, cookies, muffins, pancakes, waffles, donuts, brownies; bars, bars, such as breakfast bars, protein bars, and the like; granola products; soups and soup bases, and the like, which include plant proteins, as well as mixtures thereof that include a higher level of plant proteins, and do not impart undesirable odors or tastes due to the presence of these plant proteins.\n\nThere is also a need to create process flavors, also known as reaction flavors, which include plant proteins, as well as mixtures thereof that include a higher level of plant proteins, and do not impart undesirable odors or tastes due to the presence of these plant proteins. A reaction flavor is a flavor composition that can be used to impart, modify, or improve the flavor of a number of different foods and beverages. A process flavor is composed of a mixture of starting materials which are generally heated to yield a desired profile.\n\nThere is a need for meat-structured plant protein-derived meat extenders and meat analogs. This is best accomplished with textured versions of plant proteins, which have the protein fiber/alignment properties to best imitate the structure of meat. The art teaches textured soy protein or pea protein concentrate or isolate, processed using an extruder in the shape of rods or tubes. Textured soy or pea protein isolate is extruded into various shapes (chunks, flakes, nuggets, grains, and strips) and sizes, exiting the nozzle while still hot and expanding as it does so. The thermoplastic proteins are heated to 150-200Â° C., which denatures them into a fibrous, insoluble, porous network that can soak up as much as three times its weight in liquids. As the pressurized molten protein mixture exits the extruder, the sudden drop in pressure causes rapid expansion into a puffy solid that is then dried. As much as 50% protein when dry, textured plant protein can be rehydrated at a 2:1 ratio, which drops the percentage of protein to an approximation of ground meat at 16%.\n\nHowever, in recent years, additional information has shown that there are certain nutritional problems with consuming raw, cooked, or processed soybeans. The raw soybean is known to contain numerous anti-nutrients. Pea protein provides foods with a beany and/or bitter taste and a beany, pea aroma.\n\nThere is therefore a need for efficient, high quality and low cost high-protein food sources with acceptable taste, flavor and/or aroma profiles, and for processes for creating improved vegetarian and vegan products such as, extruded and extruded/puffed products, meat analogs and extenders, all with improved odors and/or tastes due to the presence of these plant proteins, but contain alternatives to soy protein.\n\n\nBRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION\n\n\nThe invention provides a method to prepare a food composition or compositions which comprise or include a myceliated high-protein food product. In one step, the method includes providing a myceliated high protein food product of the invention, e.g., a myceliated high-protein food product, wherein the myceliated high-protein food product is at least 50% (w/w) protein on a dry weight basis, wherein the myceliated high-protein is myceliated by an aqueous fungal culture, in a media comprising at least 50% protein in liquid culture; then, in another step, providing an edible material, and mixing the myceliated high protein food product of the invention and the edible material to form the food composition. In embodiments, the fungal culture comprises \n\nThe present invention also includes food compositions made by the invention, and food compositions that comprise a myceliated high-protein food product, wherein the myceliated high-protein food product is at least 50% (w/w) protein on a dry weight basis, wherein the myceliated high-protein is myceliated by an aqueous fungal culture, in a media comprising at least 50% protein in liquid culture; and an edible material.\n\nAlternatively, the method for preparing food compositions which comprise or include a myceliated high-protein food product, wherein the step of providing a myceliated high protein food product can include the following steps. In one embodiment, the myceliated high protein food product is produced by culturing a fungus in an aqueous media which includes a high-protein material, with amounts of protein of at least 50% (w/w) protein on a dry weight basis, and wherein the media comprises at least 50 g/L protein, inoculating with a fungal culture, and culturing the medium to produce the myceliated high protein food products whereby the flavor or taste of the myceliated high-protein food product is modulated compared to the high-protein material; providing an edible material; and mixing the myceliated high protein food product and the edible material to form the food composition. In embodiments, the fungal culture comprises \n\nThe present invention also discloses a texturized plant protein product comprising an extruded mixture comprising (a) a myceliated high-protein food product, wherein the myceliated high-protein food product is at least 50% (w/w) protein on a dry weight basis, wherein the myceliated high-protein food product is derived from pea and/or rice, wherein the myceliated high-protein product is myceliated by an aqueous fungal culture comprising \n\nThe food compositions of the invention comprise, without limitation, reaction flavors, dairy alternative products, ready to mix beverages and beverage bases; extruded and extruded/puffed products; sheeted baked goods; texturized plant-based protein products; baked goods and baking mixes; granola; and soups/soup bases.\n",

    "description": "\n\nBACKGROUND OF THE DISCLOSURE\n\n\nThe present disclosure is generally directed to non-dairy food products. In particular, the present disclosure is directed to plant-based yogurt products having a vegetable protein and macadamia nut butter.\n\nA large portion of the population is not able to consume dairy-based products since they cannot metabolize lactose, a sugar found in dairy products. Alternatives for dairy-like products are desirable because of intolerances to dairy products. Vegetarian and vegan diets are increasing in popularity and provide many benefits to individual consumers and world food requirements. These diets provide healthy nutrition (e.g., lower saturated fats, no cholesterol), absence of ethical or religious dietary conflicts, less negative environmental impacts (e.g., less greenhouse gases produced in production), and more efficient use of resources (e.g., less water used in production). Non-dairy products provide an alternative to those with intolerances and those seeking to avoid animal-based food products.\n\nNon-dairy products suffer from lower equivalent protein and fat contents than dairy, and thus, can be of lower nutritional value. Further, ingredients used in non-dairy products can contain compounds that produce unpleasant flavors and colors, can affect the appearance, sensory and nutritional qualities, and can affect the stability and shelf life of non-dairy products.\n\nAccordingly, there exists a need for non-dairy products having the nutritional content, flavor and appearance of dairy products. The present disclosure provides plant-based yogurt products having the nutritional content, flavor and appearance of dairy yogurt. It has been advantageously found that the plant-based yogurt products of the present disclosure can have a high protein content without the unpleasant taste associated with a high protein content from the plant-based protein source.\n\n\nBRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DISCLOSURE\n\n\nThe present disclosure is generally related to plant-based yogurt products having a high protein content without the unpleasant taste associated with high protein from the plant-based protein source. More particularly, it has been found that nut butters, and in particular, macadamia nut butter, can be added to a yogurt composition to mask the unpleasant taste associated with plant-based vegetable proteins.\n\nIn one aspect, the present disclosure is directed to a plant-based yogurt comprising macadamia nut butter, a vegetable protein source, and an oil, wherein the yogurt is dairy-free.\n\nIn another aspect, the present disclosure is directed to a plant-based yogurt comprising from about 1.0% by weight to about 5.0% by weight macadamia nut butter, a vegetable protein source, and an oil.\n\nIn yet another aspect, the present disclosure is directed to a plant-based yogurt comprising macadamia nut butter, a pea protein, coconut oil, and coconut cream.\n",

    "abstract": "The invention provides a process of preparing glucosyl Rebaudioside C composition. The glucosyl rebaudioside C composition is useful as in combination with other caloric and non-caloric sweeteners as well as non caloric sweetener in edible and chewable consumables such as various foods and beverages, confectionaries, bakery products, cookies, chewing gums, and the like.\n\n",
    "description": "\n\nFIELD OF THE INVENTION\n\n\nThe invention relates to a process for glucosylation of sweet glycosides of \n\n\nBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION\n\n\nHigh intensity sweeteners possess sweetness level many times exceeding that of sucrose. They are essentially non-caloric and used widely in manufacturing of diet and calorie-reduced food. Although natural caloric sweetener such as sucrose, fructose, and glucose provide the most desirable taste to consumers, they are caloric. High intensity sweeteners do not affect the blood glucose level and provide little or no nutritive value.\n\nHowever, high intensity sweeteners that generally are used as sucrose substitutes possess taste characteristics different than that of sugar, such as sweet taste with different temporal profile, maximal response, flavor profile, mouthfeel, and/or adaptation behavior than that of sugar. For example, the sweet taste of some high-potency sweeteners is slower in onset and longer in duration than that of sugar and thus changes the taste balance of a food composition. Because of these differences, usage of high-potency sweetener in replacing such a bulk sweetener as sugar in a food or beverage causes disbalance in temporal and/or flavor profile. If the taste profile of high-potency sweeteners could be modified to impart desired taste characteristics, it can provide low calorie beverages and food products with taste characteristics more desirable for consumers.\n\nOn the other hand, high-potency sweeteners may have some cost and functional advantages compared to sugar. The competition among sugar and non-sugar high-potency sweeteners is tough in soft drinks industry, in countries where their use and production is permitted and also in countries with overvalued sugar prices.\n\nAt present high intensity sweeteners are used worldwide. They can be of both synthetic and natural origin.\n\nNon-limiting examples of synthetic sweeteners include sucralose, potassium acesulfame, aspartame, alitame, saccharin, neohesperidin dihydrochalcone synthetic derivatives, cyclamate, neotame, dulcin, suosan, Nâ[N-[3-(3-hydroxy-4-methoxyphenyl)propyl]-L-â¡-aspartyl]-L-phenylalanine 1-methylester, Nâ[N-[3-(3-hydroxy-4-methoxyphenyl)-3-methylbutyl]-L-â¡-aspartyl]-L-phenylalanine 1-methylester, Nâ[N-[3-(3-methoxy-4-hydroxyphenyl)propyl]-L-â¡-aspartyl]-L-phenylalanine 1-methyl ester, salts thereof, and the like.\n\nNon-limiting examples of natural high intensity sweeteners include Stevioside, Rebaudioside A, Rebaudioside B, Rebaudioside C, Rebaudioside E, Rebaudioside F, Steviolbioside, Dulcoside A, Rubusoside, mogrosides, brazzein, neohesperidin dihydrochalcone (NHDC), glycyrrhizic acid and its salts, thaumatin, perillartine, pernandulcin, mukuroziosides, baiyunoside, phlomisoside-I, dimethyl-hexahydrofluorene-dicarboxylic acid, abrusosides, periandrin, carnosiflosides, cyclocarioside, pterocaryosides, polypodoside A, brazilin, hernandulcin, phillodulcin, glycyphyllin, phlorizin, trilobatin, dihydroflavonol, dihydroquercetin-3-acetate, neoastilibin, trans-cinnamaldehyde, monatin and its salts, selligueain A, hematoxylin, monellin, osladin, pterocaryoside A, pterocaryoside B, mabinlin, pentadin, miraculin, curculin, neoculin, chlorogenic acid, cynarin, siamenoside and others.\n\nAt present about eleven high intensity sweeteners are used worldwide. These are acesulfame-K, alitame, aspartame, cyclamate, glycyrrhizin, NHDC, saccharin, Stevioside, sucralose, thaumatin, neotame, and Rebaudioside A.\n\nThe standard sweetening power associated with each high intensity sweetener is given in TABLE 1. However, when they are used in blends, the sweetening power can change significantly.\n\nNone\n\nOn the other hand, ânaturalâ and âorganicâ foods and beverages have become the âhottest areaâ in the food industry. The combination of consumers' desire, advances in food technology, new studies linking diet to disease and disease prevention has created an unprecedented opportunity to address public health through diet and lifestyle.\n\nA growing number of consumers perceive the ability to control their health by enhancing their current health and/or hedging against future diseases. This creates a demand for food products with enhanced characteristics and associated health benefits, specifically a food and consumer market trend towards âwhole health solutionsâ lifestyle. The term ânaturalâ is highly emotive in the world of sweeteners and has been identified as one of key trust, along with âwhole grainsâ, âheart-healthyâ and âlow-sodiumâ. âNaturalâ term is closely related to âhealthierâ.\n\nIn this respect, natural high intensity sweeteners can have better commercial potential.\n\nNone\n\nAt present there are more than 230 \n\nSteviol glycosides have zero calories and can be used wherever sugar is used. They are ideal for diabetic and low calorie diets. In addition, the sweet steviol glycosides possess functional and sensory properties superior to those of many high potency sweeteners.\n\nThe extract of \n\nThe physical and sensory properties are well studied only for Stevioside and Rebaudioside A. The sweetness potency of Stevioside is around 210 times higher than sucrose, Rebaudioside A in between 200 and 400 times.\n\nGenerally production of extract includes extraction of plant material with water or water-organic solvent mixture, precipitation of high molecular weight substances, deionization, and decolorization, purification on specific macroporous polymeric adsorbents, concentration and drying.\n\nPurification techniques include re-crystallization from various organic solvents as well as chromatographic separation. As a result, besides the highly purified steviol glycosides, substantial amount of by products with 65-75% steviol glycosides content is being generated. The amount of such ânon-food gradeâ materials often exceeds the âmainâ product 2-3 times and there is a certain economic demand for re-processing of these âby-productsâ. This possesses big technical challenge as the majority of existing commercial purification processes fail to deliver satisfactory results with initial materials containing as low as 65-75% total steviol glycosides.\n\nOn the other hand commercial preparations of steviol glycosides such as \n\nOne of these disadvantages is âso-calledâ limited maximal response value. This is the maximal sweetness in sugar equivalents achievable by using a high intensity sweetener regardless how high the concentration of the sweetener is. For steviol glycosides this value is approx. 6-8%. This means when used âas-isâ steviol glycosides cannot deliver sweetness feeling which is higher than that of 6-8% sucrose solution. Considering that majority of soft drinks contain 10-13% sucrose the usage of steviol glycosides for full sugar substitution is not possible.\n\nIt has to be noted that high intensity sweeteners' taste profile is highly dependent on the concentration and usually the higher the concentration the higher the sensation of undesirable taste components such as bitterness, licorice, lingering aftertaste. This phenomenon limits the usage of steviol glycosides further to 4-5% sucrose equivalents in order to achieve pleasant taste of a food or beverage sweetened with \n\nRebaudioside C or Reb C (CAS No: 63550-99-2), also known as Dulcoside B, is the third most abundant sweet glycoside found in \n\nRecent studies show that highly purified forms of Rebaudioside C possess certain valuable properties. Particularly Rebaudioside C is capable to deliver flavor and sweetness enhancing properties.\n\nThese properties multiply the significance of Rebaudioside C and attract great interest for processes of preparation of highly purified forms of Rebaudioside C.\n\nThere are few processes described in the prior arts for Rebaudioside C preparation.\n\nU.S. Pat. No. 4,353,889 describes a process of preparation of a substance referred as âRebaudioside Câ. According to the embodiment of the patent, Rebaudioside A is refluxed with strong base in aqueous methanol medium at elevated temperature. Upon completion of the reaction the mixture is cooled and acidified with sulfuric acid to yield the base hydrolysis product called âRebaudioside Câ with 99% purity. It has to be noted that the chemical formula of the compound given in the patent actually corresponds to substance currently known to art as Rebaudioside B (CAS No: 58543-17-2).\n\nNone\n\nNone\n\nMost of the existing processes of highly purified Reb C preparation employ techniques which are only applicable for laboratory or pilot scale production.\n\nOn the other hand there's no information about the properties of glucosylated Reb C. To our knowledge, there is no published data on the glucosylation of Reb C.\n\nHence, there is a need for a simple, efficient, and economical process for production of glucosylated steviol glycosides compositions comprising Reb C.\n",

No. 11,337,435 on May 24, 2022, entitled âPRODUCT AND METHOD OF PRODUCING DAIRY PRODUCTS COMPRISING DAIRY-DERIVED EMULSIFYING SALTS,â which is incorporated by reference herein, in its entirety and for all purposes.\n\n\nTECHNICAL FIELD\n\n\nThe present disclosure relates to dairy products containing dairy-derived emulsifying salts, such as cheese or cheese-related products, and systems and methods for their manufacture.\n\n\nBACKGROUND\n\n\nIn traditional manufacturing of pasteurized process cheese, emulsifying salt chemicals like sodium phosphate and sodium citrate are added to natural cheese, and/or to blends of natural cheese and other dairy ingredients and pasteurized to transform these dairy mixtures into a molten homogenous process cheese that is cooled and packaged. Phosphate based emulsifying salts are produced from raw materials such as rocks, ore, and other mineral deposits derived from mines containing minerals, e.g., phosphate, in which the mineral is extracted therefrom using industrial chemical processing approaches and converted to a mineral-containing emulsifying salts, e.g., sodium phosphate. The added sodium phosphate emulsifying salt in process cheese aids the transformation into a molten homogenous process cheese through two aspects. First, a portion of the unbound phosphate within the sodium and phosphate equilibrium disrupts the dynamic equilibrium between bound and free calcium in the matrix by binding free calcium in the environment, causing a redistribution of protein bound calcium out and into the unbound environment liberating protein to emulsify the milk fat within the matrix. Second, due to the weak acid nature of phosphate, a disruption in the pH equilibrium in the matrix occurs where free phosphate binds free hydrogen ions in the matrix thus raising the pH and causing de-protonation of acidic functional groups on casein like aspartic and glutamic acid. This effectively hydrates the protein via solvated sodium ions exchange on the aspartic and glutamic acid residues on the protein from the sodium phosphate, or otherwise solvated free sodium in the environment.\n\n\nSUMMARY\n\n\nAccording to the present disclosure, by utilizing the phosphate and citrate naturally present in milk, one could leverage the phosphate and citrate chemistry necessary to manufacture a process cheese without the additional emulsifying salt chemicals. Accordingly, implementations are directed to dairy-derived emulsifying salts and dairy products containing these dairy-derived emulsifying agents, and systems and methods for their production.\n\nImplementations accordingly provide methods for producing a dairy product involving adjusting a phosphate+citrate-to-calcium ratio of a starting dairy material by:demineralizing the starting dairy material to remove at least one of chloride (Cl\n\nIn further implementations and alternatives, at least a portion of potassium (K\n\nThe step of demineralizing may further involve removing at least a portion of potassium (K\n\nThe step of concentrating may involve one or more of evaporative heating, spray drying or reverse osmosis or forward osmosis.\n\nOther implementations provide methods for producing a dairy product involving subjecting a dairy by-product stream to ion exchange to remove calcium; concentrating the calcium-depleted by-product stream; and combining the calcium-depleted by-product stream with dairy components to produce the dairy product. In such implementations, the dairy product contains an amount of native phosphate and citrate sufficient to emulsify fat and hydrate protein in the dairy product.\n\nIn further implementations and alternatives, the dairy by-product stream is produced by subjecting a starting dairy material to filtration to produce the by-product stream. For instance, the starting material includes one or more of pasteurized milk, milk permeate, whey, whey permeate, acid whey, acid whey permeate.\n\nIn further implementations and alternatives, the calcium-depleted by-product stream is calcium-depleted mother liquor from lactose manufacture or calcium-depleted grandmother liquor from lactose manufacture.\n\nThe starting dairy material may be subjected to crystallization to produce the by-product stream. In addition or alternatively, the step of concentrating may involve evaporative heating, spray drying, reverse osmosis or forward osmosis.\n\nOther implementations provide methods for the production of a dairy product that involve: subjecting a starting dairy material to nanofiltration to remove monovalent ions to produce an ion-depleted dairy permeate; passing the ion-depleted dairy permeate through an ion exchange column and subsequently passing a sodium-containing eluting solution through the ion exchange column to produce sodium phosphate and sodium citrate derived from the starting material; concentrating the sodium phosphate and sodium citrate; and combining the concentrated sodium phosphate and sodium citrate with dairy components to produce the dairy product. In such implementations, the dairy product contains an amount of the concentrated sodium phosphate and sodium citrate sufficient to cause fat in the dairy product to be emulsified and protein in the dairy product to be hydrated.\n\nIn further implementations and alternatives, the starting dairy material includes pasteurized milk, skim milk, buttermilk, milk permeate, whey, whey permeate, salty whey, acid whey, acid whey permeate, mother liquor from lactose manufacture or grandmother liquor from lactose manufacture.\n\nIn further implementations and alternatives, the dairy components comprises a separate dairy source from starting dairy material. The starting dairy material may be produced from one or more of ultrafiltration (UF), microfiltration (MF) or nanofiltration (NF), and for instance may be a permeate produced from the one or more of the UF or MF. For example, the starting dairy material is milk permeate.\n\nIn further implementations and alternatives, the dairy components added in the step of combining may include a concentrated milk retentate or a fermented concentrated milk retentate or a component thereof produced from the one or more of the UF or MF.\n\nThe ion exchange column may be an anion exchange column and the sodium-containing eluting solution may be a solution of sodium chloride, sodium hydroxide or a mixture thereof. In addition or alternatively, the step of concentrating the sodium phosphate and sodium citrate uses reverse osmosis.\n",

    "description": "\n\nFIELD OF THE INVENTION\n\n\nThe invention relates to a process for producing highly soluble compositions containing purified steviol glycosides from \n\n\nBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION\n\n\nHigh intensity sweeteners possess a sweetness level many times exceeding that of sucrose. They are essentially non-caloric and used widely in manufacturing of diet and reduced calorie food. Although natural caloric sweeteners such as sucrose, fructose, and glucose provide the most desirable taste to consumers, they possess high calorie values. High intensity sweeteners do not affect the blood glucose level and provide little or no nutritive value.\n\nNone\n\nAt present there are more than 230 \n\nThe extract of \n\nSteviol glycosides have zero calories and can be used wherever sugar is used. They are ideal for diabetic and low calorie diets. In addition, the sweet steviol glycosides possess functional and sensory properties superior to those of many high potency or high intensity sweeteners.\n\nRebaudioside D (CAS No: 63279-13-0), as shown in \n\nThese properties multiply the significance of Rebaudioside D and attract great interest for methods of preparation of highly purified forms of Rebaudioside D. However, highly purified steviol glycosides possess relatively low water solubility. For example Rebaudioside A thermodynamic equilibrium solubility at room temperature is only 0.8%.\n\nOn the other hand, it is well known that Rebaudioside A exhibits so called polymorphism (Zell T. M., Padden B. E., Grant D. J. W., Schroeder S. A., Wachholder K. L., Prakash I., Munsona E. J. (2000) \n\nNone\n\nRebaudioside D possesses even lower water solubility compared to Rebaudioside A. In room temperature it can be dissolved only at 0.05%. When heat is applied, one can make up to 0.5% solution, but upon cooling to room temperature, Rebaudioside D will quickly crystallize back out from the solution. Considering high sweetness intensity of Rebaudioside D, even 0.05% solubility can be sufficient for many applications.\n\nMany food production processes use highly concentrated ingredient mixes prior to producing final forms of food products. In that case, higher concentrations of dissolved Rebaudioside D will be required. It has to be noted that using the heat for dissolution of Rebaudioside D may not be possible in many compositions which contain heat sensitive components. Also maintaining high temperature of mixture for prolonged time to prevent premature crystallization of Rebaudioside D can cause thermal degradation of mixture components or undesirable changes of organoleptic properties.\n\nTherefore there is a need for developing highly soluble forms or compositions of Rebaudioside D which can provide stable solutions with minimal or no heat treatment.\n\nFurthermore, considering the similar chemical structures of Rebaudioside D and other steviol glycosides, as well as other terpene glycosides, the developed approaches may be used in the case of other glycosides as well.\n\n\nSUMMARY OF THE INVENTION\n\n\nThe invention relates to a process for producing highly soluble compositions containing purified steviol glycosides from \n\nHereinafter the term âsteviol glycoside(s)â will mean Rebaudioside A, Rebaudioside B, Rebaudioside C, Rebaudioside D, Rebaudioside E, Rebaudioside F, Stevioside, Steviolbioside, Dulcoside A, Rubusoside, or other glycoside of steviol and combinations thereof.\n\nHereinafter, unless specified otherwise the solubility of material is determined in RO (reverse osmosis) water at room temperature. Where the solubility is expressed as â%â it to be understood as number of grams of material soluble in 100 grams of solvent.\n\nHereinafter the term âhighly purifiedâ will mean purity level of at least 95% (w/w) on anhydrous basis.\n\nHereinafter the term âlow purityâ will mean purity level of less than 95% (w/w) on anhydrous basis.\n\nHereinafter the term âTSG contentâ will mean Total Steviol Glycosides content, and it will be calculated as sum of all steviol glycosides' content including Rebaudioside A, Rebaudioside B, Rebaudioside C, Rebaudioside D, Rebaudioside E, Rebaudioside F, Stevioside, Steviolbioside, Dulcoside A and Rubusoside.\n\nHereinafter the terms âReb A, B, C, D, E, Fâ refer to Rebaudiosides A, B, C, D, E, F, respectively.\n\nHereinafter the term âReb Dâ refers to Rebaudioside D (CAS No. 63279-13-0).\n\nHereinafter the term âcrystalline Rebaudioside Dâ will refer to any form of highly purified Rebaudioside D obtained by crystallization from an aqueous or aqueous alcoholic solution containing Rebaudioside D and further separating the Rebaudioside D crystals and drying them by any means known to the art.\n\nHereinafter the term âamorphous Rebaudioside Dâ will refer to any form of highly purified Rebaudioside D obtained by spray drying or freeze drying of aqueous or aqueous alcoholic solution containing Rebaudioside D.\n\nHereinafter the terms ânon-steviol glycoside fractionâ or ânon-glycoside fractionâ will mean materials predominantly comprising compounds, other than steviol glycosides, which are present in the water extracts of \n\nHereinafter the term âpolyolâ refers to a compound that contains more than one hydroxyl group. A polyol may contain 2 to 7 hydroxyl groups. Non-limiting examples of polyols include erythritol, maltitol, mannitol, sorbitol, lactitol, xylitol, inositol, isomalt, propylene glycol, glycerol (glycerine), threitol, galactitol, reduced isomalto-oligosaccharides, reduced xylo-oligosaccharides, reduced gentio-oligosaccharides, reduced maltose syrup, reduced glucose syrup or combinations thereof.\n\nHereinafter the term âmolassesâ refers to sugarcane molasses such as first molasses, second molasses, US grade âAâ, âBâ, âCâ, and substandard blackstrap molasses, as well as beet sugar molasses, boil-back molasses, high-test molasses, refiners' molasses, sweet sorghum syrup.

    "description": "\nThe present invention belongs to the sector of apparatuses and methods for high pressure processing of substances known as âpumpableâ, in particular but not limited to fluids such as beverages, cosmetics, etc.\n\n\nBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION\n\n\nHigh pressure processing (HPP) is a technology that uses pressures greater than 4,000 bar to reduce the microbial load of a product without altering the characteristics thereof.\n\nHPP equipment known for treating liquids or other substances with high pressure are based on the processing of the product previously arranged in flexible packaging, for example bottles. The classic way of high pressure processing is performed in batches of packaged products, in other words, by means of a discreet and non-continuous process. Initially, the products inside the flexible final packaging thereof are loaded into containers (made of rigid plastic) that are inserted into a steel vessel that is subsequently filled with a pressurisation fluid, generally water, leaving unoccupied gaps between the packaging. Once the vessel is full, it is completely closed and water starts to be pumped at high pressure through one or several high pressure intensifiers until reaching 4,000-6,000 bar. Said pressure is maintained for a time that can vary from seconds to several minutes. The pressure reached and the time that this pressure is maintained are the main parameters of the process and they are defined in each case based on the product that is going to be processed (which is commonly called the ârecipeâ). For example, in the case of a beverage, the technology is used for the effect of inactivating microorganisms therein and the recipe is defined based on the level of microorganism inactivation that is to be reached. Finally, the pressure is released, the containers are taken out of the inside of the vessel and the processed product is removed. The product has been sanitised, meaning that the microbial load has been reduced.\n\nIn an HPP process the pressure is transmitted to the product through the pressurisation fluid, hence the pressure is transmitted equally and instantaneously to all the points of the product. Given that the product is processed while already packaged, the filling coefficient of the vessels (relationship between the product volume to be processed and the useful volume of the vessel) is low, between 40% and 60%, depending on the geometry of the packaging and the diameter of the vessel. The main advantage of processing in batches is the absence of subsequent contamination of the product, since from the beginning it is in the final packaging thereof. On the other hand, the main disadvantage is that the low filling coefficient reached limits the productivity of traditional high pressure processing equipment. Other disadvantages of batch processing are the need to use flexible packaging that supports the effects of the high pressures, it not being possible to use materials such as glass, and the need to handle them for the loading and unloading of the HPP machine.\n\nTherefore, the need arises to search for an alternative to the current way of processing that successfully increases the filling coefficient of the vessel and avoids the restrictions of this type of packaging, ensuring that after the processing of the product no contamination is produced, this last one being the most complicated to accomplish.\n\nOver time, different solutions have been proposed, one of these consisting of processing liquids inside a bag or flexible membrane situated inside the vessel and which occupies the largest useful space possible.\n\nTo make a distinction with HPP processing of already packaged products, the process with a bag or membrane is called bulk HPP. For the sake of simplicity, hereinafter we will call the bag or membrane simply a bag.\n\nExamples of bulk HPP systems are the ones described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,993,172A or U.S. Pat. No. 6,305,913B1, where different systems for bulk HPP of pumpable substances are shown.\n\nOne of the challenges of bulk HPP equipment is ensuring that the pressurisation fluid (generally water) and the pumpable substance are not able to mix. To do so, two things must be ensured: that the connection of the bag is completely sealed and that it does not get broken.\n\nIn reference to \n\nThe filling step can present problems for the integrity of the bag, since if the amount of litres introduced is not controlled well it is possible to break the bag with the pumping pressure itself. However, breakage can also occur in the chamber depressurisation step. During this step the pressurised water, which can be at 6,000 bar, is released by instantaneously opening the unloading valves \n\nFurthermore, it is possible for the pressurisation water to not be distributed homogeneously on both sides of the vessel due to multiple reasons, such as having more pumps connected on one side than the other, or that, during unloading, the valves do not open at exactly the same time which makes more water come out on one of the sides.\n\nThe problem of this asymmetric distribution of the water in the vessel is that, when the depressurisation occurs, given that on one side there is less fluid, the bag will tend to be dragged by the unloading duct on that side. Furthermore, it is possible that small pools of water form in points of the central area of the vessel \n\nAnother step where the bag can be damaged by suction is in the emptying step, since it can be dragged towards the outlet path of the valve \n\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION\n\n\nThe object of the present invention is that of providing a system and a method that prevents differences in the distribution of the pressurisation fluid inside the vessel, the possible formation of pools of water far from the unloading areas and excess pressures generated during the filling and emptying steps of the vessel at high pressure of an HPP equipment from being a problem for the integrity of the bag or hindering the unloading of the product.\n\nTo do so, the system of the present invention provides a bag protection and securing system for bulk high pressure processing equipment provided with at least one tube with holes, covers for evacuating and connecting the ends of the tube or tubes, the tubes being, in the case that there are two or more, anchored to said covers in positions that are optionally symmetrical with respect to the central shaft of the covers; protection means for the bag adapted to lengthen and thus facilitate the outlet path of the processed product once the depressurisation of the equipment is produced and a fitting for the protection means from the bag to the cover on the side from which the product in the bag leaves. Advantageously, the holes of the tube or tubes are oriented towards the inner face of the vessel. The protection means preferably have a spiral, mesh, strap or cylinder shape with holes and they extend inside the bag to at least Â¾ of the length thereof. The tube or tubes have a circular, oval or square cross section. The holes of the tube or tubes preferably have a diameter between 2 mm and 10 mm. The covers for evacuation and connection are optionally provided with conduits for the outlet of the pressurisation fluid and the tube or tubes are provided with a telescopic section.\n\nThe invention further comprises high pressure processing equipment comprising the system of the invention and a method for the use thereof.\n",

    "description": "\n\nCROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS\n\n\nThis application claims the priority benefit of Japan Patent Application No. 2019-196847, filed on Oct. 30, 2019. The entirety of the above-mentioned patent application is hereby incorporated by reference herein and made a part of this specification.\n\n\nBACKGROUND\n\n\n\nTechnical Field\n\n\nThe disclosure relates to a food material powder supply device. In particular, the disclosure relates to a food material powder supply device including at least a cooling mechanism that cools material powder.\n\n\nRelated Art\n\n\nA plant-type food material supply device has been known which supplies the material to a food processing machine such as a mixing machine, a kneader, a stirrer, or a crusher, and has a configuration of storing particulate food material powder such as wheat flour, cornstarch, rice flour and buckwheat flour or granular food material powder such as rice grain and soybean in a storage tank, taking the material out from the storage tank, weighing the material, and then conveying a predetermined amount of the material to a supply tank.\n\nSpecifically, for example, a food material powder supply device applied to a mixer of a noodle making machine that produces udon noodle dough is configured in a manner of wheat flour called udon flour is stored in a silo corresponding to the storage tank, a predetermined amount of the wheat flour which is determined in advance is transported to the supply tank referred to as a holding bin, a hopper, or a receiver tank in one mixing operation, and the wheat flour is put into a chamber of the mixer.\n\nIn the plant-type food material supply device, the temperature of the material changes under the influence of the outside air temperature during a storage period in which the material is stored in the storage tank. Therefore, the temperature of the material before processing such as stirring, mixing, kneading, or crushing may be too high in summer and too low in winter compared with a predetermined temperature desired in the processing. If the processing cannot be performed in a state that the temperature of the material is within a predetermined temperature range, the quality of products is adversely affected. Therefore, it is required to cool or heat the material to a predetermined temperature before processing.\n\nConventionally, as a method for cooling the material, a method for directly applying cold air to the material in the supply tank to cool the material, a method for lowing the room temperature of a manufacturing site by an air conditioning facility such as a cooler to suppress the temperature rise of the material, a method for adjusting the temperature of the material by cooling the material with a jacket or the like from the outer wall of the mixing machine such as a mixer, a method for lowering the temperature of water used for the material, and the like have been used.\n\nPatent literature 1 is a disclosure related to a mixer for noodle dough, in which a blower fan 13 and a cooler 14 are arranged in an air pipe 10 connected to a mixer drum 2, and the air inside the air pipe 10 cooled by the cooler 14 is sent to the mixer drum 2 to cool the material in the mixer drum 2 (paragraph 0012, paragraph 0014, FIG. 1).\n\nIn addition, patent literature 2 is a disclosure related to a powder particle continuous stirring sterilization device, in which a cooling jacket 411 is arranged on the outer periphery of a cylindrical pressure-resistant container 5 of a cooling device 4, and a cooling medium such as water, a heat medium or the like is supplied to the inside of the cooling jacket 411 to cool the material in the cylindrical pressure-resistant container 5 (paragraph 0042, FIG. 1).\n\nHowever, since the food material powder which is fine and represents the wheat flour has a small thermal conductivity and a particulate form, there is a feature that it is difficult to transfer heat between the powders and it is difficult to uniformly apply the cold air to all the material powders, and there has been problems that by a conventional method for applying the cold air to cool the material (patent literature 1) or a conventional method for cooling the outer wall of the supply tank (patent literature 2), it is impossible to cool the powder in a short time or to cool the powder uniformly.\n\nIn view of the above problems, the inventors have already invented and disclosed a food material powder supply device in which a vacuum pump is connected to a supply tank, the pressure inside the supply tank is lowered to be equal to or lower than a pressure at which moisture is evaporated, thereby a part of the moisture retained by the powder is forcibly evaporated, and the material powder is cooled utilizing the latent heat at that time (patent literature 3). By using the food material powder supply device of the disclosure, the material powder in the supply tank can be uniformly cooled in a short time.\n\nPatent literature 1: Japanese Patent Laid-open No. 2005-143357\n\nPatent literature 2: Japanese Patent No. 3941903\n\nPatent literature 3: Japanese Patent No. 6541863\n\nThe inventors have conducted further experiments on the food material powder supply device, and have encountered the following three problems (1), (2), and (3).\n\n(1) Compaction of Material Powder\n\nIn the supply tank in which the material powder is stored, the material powder in the lower layer is compressed by the weight of the material powder in the upper layer, the space between the powders is reduced, and the lower layer becomes dense. When the lower layer becomes dense, there is a problem that moisture evaporation of the material powder in the lower layer is hindered by the upper layer, the temperature of the material powder in the lower layer does not drop appropriately, a temperature difference is generated between the upper and lower layers, and the uniform cooling of all of the material powders cannot be realized.\n\nIn addition, when atmosphere release is performed from the upper part of the supply tank after the supply tank is set in the depressurization state, air suddenly enters the inside of the supply tank from an atmosphere release port, the material powder is compressed due to the air that has entered, and the compaction of the material powder in the lower layer is further accelerated.\n\n(2) Remaining of Steam in Housing\n\nWhen the pressure inside the supply tank is reduced by a vacuum pump, the moisture retained by the material powder evaporates, and the steam stays inside the supply tank. If the steam continues to stay in the supply tank, the increase in the vacuum degree inside the supply tank slows down, which becomes a factor that hinders the temperature reduction of the material powder.\n\n(3) Increase in Running Cost\n\nSince when the material powder in the supply tank is cooled to a desired temperature, it is usually necessary to continue operation of the vacuum pump, a problem that the running cost increases is caused. In addition, if the operating time of the vacuum pump becomes longer, the life of the vacuum pump becomes shorter, and there is also a concern about an increase in the maintenance cost, such as an increase in the number of times of exchange of the vacuum pump or the number of times of maintenance.\n\nTherefore, an objective of the disclosure is to provide a food material powder supply device capable of preventing compaction of material powder and retention of steam in a supply tank, and cooling all of the material powder uniformly and quickly. Furthermore, an objective of the disclosure is to provide a food material powder supply device capable of cooling material powder appropriately with minimum power consumption.\n\n\nSUMMARY\n\n\nA food material powder supply device of the disclosure includes a supply tank that temporarily stores food material powder in a tank and supplies the food material powder to a processing container of a food processing machine, a vacuum device that reduces the pressure inside the supply tank with vacuum pumps, and a control device that operates the vacuum device to reduce the internal pressure of the supply tank to be equal to or lower than an atmospheric pressure at which moisture of the food material powder is evaporated, and cools the food material powder in the supply tank. A stirring member which is driven to rotate during the cooling of the food material powder is arranged inside the tank.\n\nIn the embodiment, the âfood material powder supply deviceâ in the specification is a wheat flour supply system, the âprocessing container of food processing machineâ in the specification is a chamber of a mixer, and the âsupply tankâ in the specification is a holding bin.\n\n\nIn the food material powder supply device of the disclosure, the stirring member has a stirring blade, and the stirring blade is formed into a shape of being spirally wound along the inner wall of the tank.\n\nAccording to the disclosure, since the stirring blade is formed into a spiral shape along the inner wall of the tank, when the stirring blade rotates, it becomes possible to carry the material powder in the lower layer from the bottom to the top while stirring the material powder and to carry the material powder in the upper layer from the top to the bottom.\n\nIn the food material powder supply device of the disclosure, the stirring blade includes a main blade and an auxiliary blade.\n\nAccording to the disclosure, since the stirring blade having a spiral shape is configured by the main blade and the auxiliary blade, and the main blade and the auxiliary blade are arranged at point-symmetric positions centered on a main shaft, it becomes possible that the material powder in the lower layer which enters the gap of the main blade is lifted up to the upper layer and stirred by the auxiliary blade.\n\nIn the food material powder supply device of the disclosure, the vacuum device includes a filter connected to a gas discharge port of the supply tank, and a cold trap arranged close to the gas discharge port of the filter.\n\nAccording to the disclosure, since the cold trap is arranged close to the discharge port of the filter, it becomes possible to quickly discharge the steam generated in the tank from the inside of the tank and capture the steam with the cold trap, and the temperature of the material powder can be lowered quickly.\n\nIn the food material powder supply device of the disclosure, the cold trap is cooled to a temperature lower than the temperature of the food material powder.\n\nAccording to the disclosure, since the temperature of the cold trap is set to be lower than the temperature of the food material powder, the steam evaporated from the food material powder can be collected more quickly by the cold trap, and it becomes possible to rapidly reduce the amount of the steam in the supply tank and to more quickly lower the temperature of the material powder.\n\nIn the food material powder supply device of the disclosure, the vacuum device includes a drain tank that temporarily stores drainage collected by the cold trap.\n\nAccording to the disclosure, since the drain tank which temporarily stores the drainage collected by the cold trap is arranged on the lower part of the cold trap, the drainage that is stored can be collectively discharged at one time.\n\nIn the food material powder supply device of the disclosure, the vacuum device includes a first vibrating member attached to the filter.\n\nAccording to the disclosure, since the first vibrating member can vibrate to give vibration to the filter, the material powder deposited on the filter falls and is removed, the clogging of the filter can be prevented, and it becomes possible to quickly reduce the pressure inside the tank.\n\nIn the food material powder supply device of the disclosure, an atmosphere release port is arranged on the lower part of the tank.\n\nAccording to the disclosure, since the atmosphere release port is arranged on the lower part of the tank, the material powder is pressed by the air which suddenly flows into the tank and pushed upward in the tank during the atmosphere release, and it becomes possible to prevent the material powder from being compacted.\n\nIn the food material powder supply device of the disclosure, a warming member is arranged in the tank.\n\nAccording to the disclosure, since the warming member is arranged in the tank and the temperature of the inner wall of the tank is set to be higher than that of the material powder, dew condensation on the inner wall of the tank can be prevented, and the material powder can be prevented from adhering to the inner wall of the tank. Thus, all the material powder can be discharged from the discharge port without any waste, and it becomes possible to improve cleanability of the inside of the tank.\n\nIn the food material powder supply device of the disclosure, an inspection window and an illumination member are arranged on the upper part of the tank.\n\nAccording to the disclosure, since the inspection window and the illumination member are arranged on the upper part of the tank, the state of the inside of the tank can be checked from the outside during the cooling of the material powder.\n\nIn the food material powder supply device of the disclosure, an inspection door is arranged on the center part of the tank.\n\nConventionally, the inside of the tank has been cleaned using opening parts arranged on the upper and lower surfaces of the tank, and thus the cleanability is very poor. According to the disclosure, since a plurality of inspection doors are arranged on the center part of the tank, it becomes possible for an operator to open and close the inspection door with a grip portion to easily and quickly clean the inside of the tank.\n\nIn the food material powder supply device of the disclosure, a second vibrating member is arranged on the center part of the tank.\n\nAccording to the disclosure, since the second vibrating member is arranged on the center part of the tank and the second vibrating member vibrates to give vibration to the tank, it is possible to reliably drop the material powder adhering to the inner wall of the tank toward the discharge port, and all of the material powder can be discharged from the discharge port without any waste.\n\nIn the food material powder supply device of the disclosure, the control device performs control so as to measure the pressure inside the supply tank, and stop the vacuum pump when the pressure becomes equal to or lower than a reference value to maintain the depressurization state in the supply tank.\n\nThe âreference valueâ of the disclosure has the same meaning as an âinternal pressure reference valueâ in the specification.\n\nAccording to the disclosure, the pressure inside the supply tank is measured by a pressure sensor, the vacuum pump is driven until the pressure turns to be a preset reference value, and then the vacuum pump is stopped to maintain the internal pressure of the tank.

    "description": "\nâThis is a national stage application filed under 35 U.S.C. Â§ 371 of pending international application PCT/EP2019/062318, filed May 14, 2019, which claims priority to Belgian Patent Application No. 20185322, filed May 17, 2018, the entirety of which applications are hereby incorporated by reference herein.â\n\n\nFIELD OF THE INVENTION\n\n\nThe present invention concerns a roasting system of particulate material, such as coffee or cacao beans, grains, malt.\n\n\nBACKGROUND TO THE INVENTION\n\n\nAlthough roasting of particulate material, such as cacao or coffee beans, is undertaken in large industrial installations, it remains an extremely delicate operation, requiring a particular expertise. The chemical composition of the material changes during roasting: its appearance, as well as the development of flavours and tastes, evolve during this operation. In addition, some elements disappear on contact with heat, while others combine.\n\nAccording to known solutions in the industry, roasting takes place in a circular or cylindrical grill, called a roaster. This is a device equipped with a permanently rotating drum so that the material, always moving, is roasted in a uniform way and without being burned. The heat source must be regulated because the reactions evolve during roasting. At the end of the operation, the material must be cooled rapidly to interrupt the chemical processes.\n\nDuring roasting, the particulate material must reach a uniform temperature within itself, in order to obtain the best possible quality. Some techniques are distinguished by their duration and by the amount of heat used. The traditional method operates at low temperature for a long time, entailing a small production quantity but obtaining the best quality. In contrast, industrial processes that allow faster production speeds are generally performed at higher temperatures, with the result that a portion of the material will be burned, releasing less refined flavours.\n\nAt present, energy is not used optimally in roasting devices, and numerous losses can be highlighted, for example with regard to an open system with emissions of gas and/or roasting steam to the outside of the system. In addition, energy consumption can prove to be substantial when it concerns industrial processes operating at high temperature. Emissions treatment installations are not optimally adjusted and operate at high power levels, which can have an impact on the environment.\n\n\nSUMMARY\n\n\nThe object of the embodiments of the invention is to propose a particulate material roasting system for which the amount of energy required is reduced. More particularly, the embodiments of the invention are intended to propose a particulate material roasting system capable of being implemented industrially and of operating at low temperature in order to obtain roasted material of better quality, with low energy consumption, and at high production rates. To do this, maximum use of renewable energy is considered, avoiding the use of fossil fuel so as to reduce carbon emissions.\n\nAccording to a first aspect of the invention, a system is proposed for roasting particulate material, such as coffee or cacao beans, grains, malt, said system comprising:\n\na concentrated solar collector configured for heating a fluid;\n\na heat storage device configured for storing heat of the heated fluid;\n\na particulate material roasting device comprising a treatment compartment configured for receiving the particulate material, at least one generation unit configured for generating at least one gas and/or steam flow with a controlled temperature, through said treatment compartment; said at least one generation unit being configured for exchanging heat between said at least one gas and/or steam flow and a second flow;\n\na circulation system configured for generating the second flow by using heat stored in the storage device, and optionally configured for using directly the heated fluid.\n\nThe system is therefore based on a renewable energy source, a heat storage device deriving from this source, and a roasting device fed by the heat produced and/or stored. The circulation system ensures the delivery of a flow of heat to the roasting device, as well as an exchange of heat between this flow and the roasting device.\n\nTaking account of future energy challenges, the development of sustainable energy sources is becoming more and more topical. However, because energy from these is delivered irregularly, their development is closely linked to that of adequate energy storage systems.\n\nThe development of efficient and low cost solutions for thermal energy storage therefore appears to be crucial in light of the advent of heat recovery as well as that of renewable energy such as solar energy. An installation based on solar energy allows the generation of energy on demand, and not only when the sun is shining A concentrated solar energy thermal installation converts solar energy into thermal energy and can therefore store thermal energy, which can subsequently be converted into electrical energy if necessary, by means of a turbine.\n\nAccording to a preferred embodiment, the concentrated solar collector and the heat storage device are configured for operating in a range of temperatures between 150Â° C. and 350Â° C., preferably between 200Â° C. and 300Â° C.\n\nIn this way, a quality of particulate material is obtained comparable to that which is obtained with a traditional roasting method. This range of temperature also allows the reduction of thermal energy consumption while ensuring that quality.\n\nAccording to a preferred embodiment, the concentrated solar collector comprises at least one parabolic mirror collector.\n\nIndeed, the inventors have discovered that with this solution the ground surface area of the thermal energy production installation is reduced compared to other solutions. Optionally, photovoltaic panels may be used for the generation of electricity feeding the mechanical devices.\n\nAccording to a preferred embodiment, the heat storage device comprises at least one phase change material.\n\nIndeed, among existing technologies for storing thermal energy, latent heat storage through the use of phase change materials proves to be an attractive solution since it can lead to a reduced storage size. Phase change materials are materials capable of undergoing a phase transition at a constant temperature. Storage and recovery of energy occur during these phase change processes, and the amount of energy corresponds to their latent heat, which is relatively high compared to sensible heat storage systems.\n\nAccording to an exemplary embodiment, said at least one phase change material comprises an upstream phase change material and a downstream phase change material. Preferably, the melting temperature of the upstream phase change material is higher than the melting temperature of the downstream phase change material. Preferably, the solidification temperature of the upstream phase change material is higher than the solidification temperature of the downstream phase change material.\n\nIn this way, if the incident light intensity is low, at least a portion of the heat storage device is in the liquid state and allows the release of useable energy to the roasting device. This configuration involving different phase change materials arranged in layers has higher energy efficiency than a configuration involving only one phase change material.\n\nAccording to an exemplary embodiment, said at least one phase change material comprises any one or a combination of the following materials: organic material such as paraffin or fatty acids, potassium-acetate or sodium-acetate combination, eutectic mixture of molten salts such as potassium chloride and lithium bromide, metals and their alloys, hydrated salts.\n\nThe examples cited above are widely used in scientific and technical literature as reference phase change materials for industrial installations.\n\nAccording to a preferred embodiment, the heat storage device comprises at least one material capable of storing heat by means of a thermochemical reaction.\n\nIndeed, thermochemical storage is the most common alternative to the use of phase change materials. Indeed, these two techniques have similar storage capacities and costs. Reversible thermochemical reactions, such as adsorption or adhesion of a substance to the surface of a solid or a liquid, can be used for accumulating and restoring heat on demand using different chemical reagents.\n\nAccording to an exemplary embodiment, said at least one material capable of storing heat by a thermochemical reaction comprises any one or a combination of the following materials: lithium-chloride, zeolites, silica-gels, porous salt hydrates.\n\nThe examples cited above are widely used in scientific and technical literature as reference materials capable of storing heat by one or more thermochemical reactions for industrial installations.\n\nAccording to a preferred embodiment, the heated fluid is composed of steam. According to another preferred embodiment, the heated fluid is composed of thermal oil.\n\nIndeed, steam and thermal oil have attractive calorific capacities for the development of an industrial facility.\n\nAccording to a preferred embodiment, the circulation system comprises a first collector branch and a second collector branch, a first valve in the first collector branch and a second valve in the second collector branch, and a pump unit configured for pumping the second flow through the first collector branch and the second collector branch. The concentrated solar collector comprises a first collecting unit in the first collector branch and a second collecting unit in the second collector branch.\n\nThus, the system of valves ensures that a preconfigured fluid temperature is reached at the output of the concentrated solar collector, irrespective of the amount of available solar radiation. Thus, if the intensity of solar radiation decreases, the valves close and the fluid circulates more slowly in the concentrated solar collector. This system allows the use of a single pump.\n\nAccording to a preferred embodiment, the circulation system comprises a first generation branch and a second generation branch, a first valve in the first generation branch and a second valve in the second generation branch, and a pump unit configured for pumping the second flow through the first generation branch and the second generation branch. Said at least one generation unit comprises a first generation unit coupled to the first generation branch and a second generation unit coupled to the second generation branch, a first heat exchanger in the first generation unit and a second generation heat exchanger in the second generation unit.\n\nThus, the device of valves allowing regulation of the temperature of the gas and/or steam flow in the generation units allows the use of a single pump. For regulating these temperatures, the valves can open more and more until reaching a certain percentage of the maximum opening capacity. Beyond this value, the pump can start pumping further for regulating said temperatures.\n\nAccording to an exemplary embodiment, the pump unit comprises a pump and a variable speed drive configured for controlling the speed of the pump.\n\nThus, the pump unit is configured for using a minimal amount of electrical energy for pumping the second flow through each branch of the circulation system, such that said valves are opened in such a way that the pressure drop is minimised.\n\nAccording to a preferred embodiment, a generation unit of said at least one generation unit comprises a heat exchanger with a first branch in which a gas and/or steam flow circulates, and a second branch in which the second flow generated by the circulation system circulates. Said heat exchanger allows regulation of the temperature of said gas and/or steam flow.\n\nAccording to a preferred embodiment, said at least one generation unit comprises a first generation unit, a second generation unit, and a heat exchanger with a first branch in which the gas and/or steam flow generated by the first generation unit circulates, and a second branch in which a gas and/or steam flow generated by the second generation unit circulates. Said heat exchanger allows the recovery of the energy from the gas and/or steam flow generated by the second generation unit and that has passed through the treatment compartment.\n\nIn this way, each generation unit can communicate with the circulation system or with another generation unit via heat exchangers, so as to regulate the temperature of the gas and/or steam flow.\n\nAccording to an exemplary embodiment, the system further comprises a control system configured for controlling said heat exchanger between a generation unit and the circulation system, and/or said heat exchanger between a first generation unit and a second generation unit, in order to regulate the temperature of the gas and/or steam flow generated by said generation unit.\n\nAccording to an exemplary embodiment, the system further comprises a fan arranged in said first branch, and a valve arranged between said first branch and a fresh air inlet. The control system is configured for controlling the fan and/or the valve.\n\nAs described above, the temperature of the gas and/or steam flow of each generation unit is regulated via heat exchangers. The speed and the composition of these flows are respectively regulated by the use of fans and adjustable valves.\n\nAccording to a preferred embodiment, said at least one generation unit comprises a first generation unit and a second generation unit. The first generation unit is configured for using directly, that is to say without recourse to a heat exchanger, at least a portion of the gas and/or steam flow generated by the second generation unit, preferably of a generation unit downstream of said first generation unit, and which has passed through the treatment compartment, for generating its own gas and/or steam flow.\n\nThus, not only energy but also material can be transferred from one generation unit to another.\n\nAccording to an exemplary embodiment, the first generation unit comprises a valve configured for regulating the gas and/or steam flow from the second generation unit to the first generation unit. The system further comprises a control system configured for controlling said valve in order to regulate the temperature and/or the composition of the gas and/or steam flow generated by the first generation unit.\n\nThis valve allows the regulation of the portion of the flow coming from the second generation unit that is redirected towards the first generation unit.\n\nAccording to a preferred embodiment, the roasting device comprises a transport system configured for transporting a layer of particulate material through the treatment compartment comprising a first zone, one or more intermediate zones and a last zone such that the particulate material consecutively passes through the first zone, the intermediate zones, and the last zone.\n\nThe existing solution for roasting particulate material is the use of the batch or discontinuous method, wherein particulate material is shaken in a rotating drum while hot air is blown through it. This method produces batches of roasted material at regular intervals. The advantages of transporting a layer of particulate material, allowing continuous operation, through a treatment compartment comprising several zones are the reduction of the amount of mechanical energy to be supplied during the roasting as well as the possibility of working at lower temperatures that can be adjusted so as to achieve an optimal roasting, resulting in higher quality roasted material. Although the method of roasting using a treatment compartment comprising a plurality of zones is the preferred method according to the aim of the embodiments of the present invention, the use of one or more rotary drums combined with a concentrated solar collector and a heat storage device may be considered. As these two methods do not operate in the same range of temperatures, different configurations and operating regimes may be considered for the production and storage of heat.\n\nAccording to an exemplary embodiment, the transport system comprises feeding means configured for feeding the particulate material such that the layer has a thickness which comprises not more than 10 particles of the particulate material, such as beans, preferably not more than 3 particles, more preferably not more than 2 particles.\n\nIn this way, the determination of the maximum height of the layer of particulate material, that is to say of the number of particles that can be superimposed without these particles adhering to each other, ensures a uniform temperature within all the particles. By providing a thin layer, it is easier to make the temperature within the particles more homogeneous.\n\nAccording to a preferred embodiment, said at least one generation unit comprises: a first generation unit configured for generating a first gas and/or steam flow through the first zone; one or more intermediate generation units configured for generating one or more intermediate gas and/or steam flows through the intermediate zone or zones; a last generation unit configured for generating a last gas and/or steam flow through the last zone; a control system configured for controlling said first generation unit, said intermediate generation unit or units, and said last generation unit, such that the layer of particulate material is preheated and dried in the first zone, roasted in the intermediate zone or zones, and cooled in the last zone.\n\nThus, this roasting device is divided into different zones, where each zone has a different temperature in order to reach in each zone a certain predetermined temperature within the particulate material, the heating being provided by gas and/or steam.\n\nAccording to an exemplary embodiment, the control system is configured for using at least a portion of the gas and/or steam flow that has passed through one of the zones for generating the gas and/or steam flow of another zone, preferably of a zone upstream of said zone.\n\nThis heat recovery and recirculation system allows the reduction of both the consumption of thermal energy and the level of gas and/or steam emissions to the outside. The use of at least a portion of the gas and/or steam flow that has passed through a zone downstream of the zone that recovers this flow has the advantage that the latter is at a higher temperature. Thus, the amount of heat recovered is greater.\n\nAccording to a preferred embodiment, the concentrated solar collector, the heat storage device, the particulate material roasting device and the circulation system form a substantially closed system, such that substantially no energy escapes from the substantially closed system.\n\nThus, designing a closed system allows the reduction of both the consumption of thermal energy and the level of emissions of gas and/or roasting steam to the outside of the system.

    "description": "\n\nTECHNICAL FIELD\n\n\nThe present invention relates to a smoking article comprising a combustible heat source and an aerosol-forming substrate downstream of the combustible heat source.\n\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE RELATED ART\n\n\nA number of smoking articles in which tobacco is heated rather than combusted have been proposed in the art. One aim of such âheatedâ smoking articles' is to reduce known harmful smoke constituents of the type produced by the combustion and pyrolytic degradation of tobacco in conventional cigarettes. In one known type of heated smoking article, an aerosol is generated by the transfer of heat from a combustible heat source to an aerosol-forming substrate. The aerosol-forming substrate may be located within, around or downstream of the combustible heat source. During smoking, volatile compounds are released from the aerosol-forming substrate by heat transfer from the combustible heat source and entrained in air drawn through the smoking article. As the released compounds cool, they condense to form an aerosol that is inhaled by the user. Typically, air is drawn into such known heated smoking articles through one or more airflow channels provided through the combustible heat source and heat transfer from the combustible heat source to the aerosol-forming substrate occurs by convection and conduction.\n\nFor example, WO-A2-2009/022232 discloses a smoking article comprising a combustible heat source, an aerosol-forming substrate downstream of the combustible heat source, and a heat-conducting element around and in direct contact with a rear portion of the combustible heat source and an adjacent front portion of the aerosol-forming substrate. To provide a controlled amount of convective heating of the aerosol-forming substrate, at least one longitudinal airflow channel is provided through the combustible heat source. In the smoking article of WO-A2-2009/022232, the surface of the aerosol-forming substrate abuts the combustible heat source and, in use, air drawn through the smoking article comes into direct contact with the rear end surface of the combustible heat source.\n\nIn known heated smoking articles in which heat transfer from the combustible heat source to the aerosol-forming substrate occurs primarily by convection, the convective heat transfer and hence the temperature in the aerosol-forming substrate can vary considerably depending upon the puffing behaviour of the user. As a result, the composition and hence the sensory properties of the mainstream aerosol inhaled by the user may be disadvantageously highly sensitive to a user's puffing regime.\n\nIn known heated smoking articles in which air drawn through the heated smoking article comes into direct contact with the combustible heat source of the heated smoking article, puffing by a user results in activation of combustion of the combustible heat source. Intense puffing regimes may therefore lead to sufficiently high convective heat transfer to cause spikes in the temperature of the aerosol-forming substrate, disadvantageously leading to pyrolysis and potentially even localised combustion of the aerosol-forming substrate. As used herein, the term âspikeâ is used to describe a short-lived increase in the temperature of the aerosol-forming substrate.\n\nThe levels of undesirable pyrolytic and combustion by-products in the mainstream aerosols generated by such known heated smoking articles may also disadvantageously vary significantly depending upon the particular puffing regime adopted by the user.\n\nIt is known to include additives in the combustible heat sources of heated smoking articles in order to improve the ignition and combustion properties of the combustible heat sources. However, the inclusion of ignition and combustion additives can give rise to decomposition and reaction products, which disadvantageously enter air drawn through the aerosol-forming substrates of the heated smoking articles during use thereof.\n\nA number of previous attempts have been made to reduce or eliminate undesirable smoke constituents from the air drawn through the aerosol-forming substrates of heated smoking articles with a combustible heat source during use thereof. For example, a number of previous attempts have been made to reduce the amount of carbon monoxide produced during combustion of carbonaceous heat sources for heated smoking articles by using catalysts in the carbonaceous heat source to convert carbon monoxide produced during combustion of the carbonaceous heat source into carbon dioxide.\n\nU.S. Pat. No. 5,040,551 discloses a method for reducing the amount of carbon monoxide produced during combustion of a carbonaceous fuel element for a heated smoking article comprising an aerosol generating means. The method comprises coating some or all of the exposed surfaces of the carbonaceous fuel element with a thin, microporous layer of solid particulate matter, which is substantially non-combustible at temperatures in which the carbonaceous fuel element combusts. The coating may additionally include catalytic ingredients. According to U.S. Pat. No. 5,040,551, the microporous layer must be sufficiently thin, and therefore permeable to air, so as not to unduly prevent the carbonaceous fuel from combusting. Consequently, air drawn through the smoking article of U.S. Pat. No. 5,040,551 comes into direct contact with the surface of the carbonaceous fuel element, leading to increased levels of undesirable smoke constituents.\n\nU.S. Pat. No. 5,060,667 discloses a smoking article comprising a combustible fuel element, a hollow heat transfer tube circumscribing the fuel element, a flavor source material circumscribing the heat transfer tube, and a porous wrapper circumscribing the smoking article. The heat transfer tube is open at its upstream end and closed at its downstream end and has an annular flange at its upstream end having an outside diameter substantially the same as that of the smoking article and a centrally disposed opening in alignment with the combustible end element. The closed downstream end of the heat transfer tube and the annular flange at the upstream end of the heat transfer tube prevent smoke from the fuel element from entering the smokers mouth\n\nTo facilitate aerosol formation, the aerosol-forming substrates of heated smoking articles typically comprise a polyhydric alcohol, such as glycerine, or other known aerosol-formers. During storage and smoking, such aerosol-formers may migrate from the aerosol-forming substrates of known heated smoking articles to the combustible heat sources thereof. Migration of aerosol-formers to the combustible heat sources of known heated smoking articles can disadvantageously lead to decomposition of the aerosol-formers, particularly during smoking of the heated smoking articles.\n\nA number of previous attempts have been made to inhibit migration of aerosol-formers from the aerosol-forming substrates of heated smoking articles to the combustible heat sources thereof. Generally, such previous attempts have involved enveloping the aerosol-forming substrate of a heated smoking article within a non-combustible capsule, such as a metallic cage, to reduce migration of aerosol-formers from the aerosol-forming substrate to the combustible heat source during storage and use. However, the combustible heat source is still allowed to come into direct contact with aerosol-formers from the aerosol-forming substrate during storage and use and air drawn through the aerosol-forming substrate for inhalation by a user may still come into direct contact with the surface of the combustible heat source. This disadvantageously allows decomposition and combustion gases generated from the combustible heat source to be drawn into the mainstream aerosol of such known heated smoking articles.\n\nThere remains a need for a heated smoking article comprising a combustible heat source with opposed front and rear faces and an aerosol-forming substrate downstream of the rear face of the combustible heat source in which spikes in the temperature of the aerosol-forming substrate are avoided under intense puffing regimes. In particular, there remains a need for a heated smoking article comprising a combustible heat source with opposed front and rear faces and an aerosol-forming substrate downstream of the rear face of the combustible heat source in which substantially no combustion or pyrolysis of the aerosol-forming substrate occurs under intense puffing regimes.\n\nThere further remains a need for a heated smoking article comprising a combustible heat source with opposed front and rear faces and an aerosol-forming substrate downstream of the rear face of the combustible heat source in which combustion and decomposition products formed during ignition and combustion of the combustible heat source are prevented or inhibited from entering air drawn through the aerosol-forming substrate during use of the heated smoking article.\n\nThere also further remains a need for a heated smoking article comprising a combustible heat source with opposed front and rear faces and an aerosol-forming substrate downstream of the rear face of the combustible heat source in which migration of aerosol-former from the aerosol-forming substrate to the combustible heat source is substantially prevented or inhibited.\n\n\nSUMMARY\n\n\nAccording to the invention, there is provided a smoking article comprising: a combustible heat source with opposed front and rear faces; an aerosol-forming substrate downstream of the rear face of the combustible heat source; an outer wrapper circumscribing the aerosol-forming substrate and at least a rear portion of the combustible heat source; and one or more airflow pathways along which air may be drawn through the smoking article for inhalation by a user. The combustible heat source is isolated from the one or more airflow pathways such that, in use, air drawn through the smoking article along the one or more airflow pathways does not directly contact the combustible heat source.\n\nAccording to the invention there is also provided a combustible heat source with opposed front and rear faces for use in a smoking article according to the invention, wherein the combustible heat source has a non-combustible, substantially air impermeable first barrier provided on at least substantially the entire rear face of the combustible heat source. In certain preferred embodiments, the first barrier comprises a first barrier coating provided on the rear face of the combustible heat source. In such embodiments, preferably the first barrier comprises a first barrier coating provided on at least substantially the entire rear face of the combustible heat source. More preferably, the first barrier comprises a first barrier coating provided on the entire rear face of the combustible heat source.\n\nAccording to the invention there is further provided a method of reducing or eliminating increases in temperature of an aerosol-forming substrate of a smoking article during puffing. The method comprises providing a smoking article comprising: a combustible heat source with opposed front and rear faces; an aerosol-forming substrate downstream of the rear face of the combustible heat source; an outer wrapper circumscribing the aerosol-forming substrate and at least a rear portion of the combustible heat source; and one or more airflow pathways along which air may be drawn through the smoking article for inhalation by a user, wherein the combustible heat source is isolated from the one or more airflow pathways such that, in use, air drawn through the smoking article along the one or more airflow pathways does not directly contact the combustible heat source.\n",

    "abstract": "An energy-promoting composition includes an exogenous ketone body component that provides a source of caloric energy, a vasodilator component, a stimulant component, such as caffeine, and optionally a nootropic component. In most if not all cases, the vasodilator, stimulant, and nootropic components do not themselves provide a source of caloric energy but may increase metabolism of available caloric energy. The separate components beneficially and synergistically interact with one another to enhance the overall energy-promoting effect of the composition more rapidly and to a greater degree than if one or more of the components are omitted. The energy-promoting composition is also formulated to minimize the crash effect common to stimulants such as energy drinks.\n\n",
    "description": "\n\nBACKGROUND\n\n\nEnergy drinks are beverages used by consumers to promote wakefulness, maintain alertness, and enhance mood and cognition. Typical gas station energy drinks include common ingredients such as caffeine and sugar. Some may also include vitamins, electrolytes, or amino acids.\n\nDespite widespread use, there are several health concerns surrounding consumption of gas station energy drinks, particularly surrounding their effects on the cardiovascular system. Such energy drinks have been shown to increase heart rate, increase blood pressure, and even thicken the blood. Energy drinks may also affect the brain in undesirable ways, such as by raising stress levels and inducing anxiety, insomnia, gastrointestinal irritation, muscle twitching, and periods of prolonged restlessness.\n\nEnergy drinks are also associated with high levels of fatigue, irritability, and sub-optimal cognition following the initial boost after consumption. This energy âcrashâ can be long lasting and unpleasant. As the stimulating effects wear off, levels of adrenaline, dopamine, and acetylcholine begin to drop, and blood sugar levels may swing erratically, often leaving the user feeling more fatigued, irritable, and unfocused than before consuming the energy drink. In the case of caffeine in particular, the user's adenosine levels may continue to rise after dosing. When caffeine is no longer available to block adenosine receptors, the rapid flood of built-up adenosine to the receptors can contribute to the perceived crash.\n\nTo date, popular gas station energy drinks have generally failed to improve the overall quality of life and well-being of users. Rather, such energy drinks provide a short-lived boost in desired alertness but with a subsequent crash that often tends to be so uncomfortable as to negate the benefits and place consumption of energy drinks as a net negative experience. When used to stay awake while driving, gas station energy drinks can cause high levels of stress and possibly contribute to âroad rageâ. For long haul drives, the mental and/or physical âcrashâ by the user is potentially harmful or even fatal if it leads to a highway crash.\n\nAccordingly, there is an ongoing need for compositions that are capable of promoting a natural and sustained feeling of wakefulness, maintaining a natural feeling of alertness without jitteriness, increasing concentration, enhancing mood, and/or enhancing cognition without the typical energy crash and without damaging the long-term physiological or mental health of the user.\n\n\nSUMMARY\n\n\nDisclosed herein are energy-promoting compositions formulated to provide rapid and effective onset of physical and mental energy, while minimizing or avoiding typical crash effects that plague conventional energy-promoting products, particularly gas station energy drinks advertised on billboards, radio, and television. In one embodiment, the energy-promoting composition is formulated as a liquid energy drink. Other embodiments may include other dosage forms.\n\nIn one embodiment, the energy-promoting composition comprises: (i) a caloric energy source comprising an exogenous ketone body component; (ii) a vasodilator component; and (iii) a stimulant component that increases alertness. The energy-promoting composition may further optionally comprise (iv) a nootropic component, such as a dopamine and/or acetylcholine promoter. In most if not all cases, the vasodilator, stimulant, and nootropic components do not provide caloric energy.\n\nThe main, if not exclusive, caloric energy source comprises an exogenous ketone body component, such as beta-hydroxybutyrate and/or acetoacetate. The ketone body component may be provided as a salt, ester, free acid (i.e., beta-hydroxybutyric acid, acetoacetic acid), or combination thereof. It may also include a ketone body precursor, such as 1,3-butanediol or ester thereof.\n\nThe vasodilator component may comprise one or more of quercetin, L-citrulline and/or salt thereof, L-arginine and/or salt thereof, agmatine and/or salt thereof, nitrates, gallic acid, coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10), trimethylglycine, niacin, theanine, theobromine, garlic, magnesium, grape seed extract, green tea extract, catechins and/or epicatechins (e.g., Vaso 6), cacao, proanthocyanidins, galloylated proanthocyanidins, L-norvaline, beta-alanine, glutathione, and taurine. In some embodiments, the vasodilator component is a (â)-epicatechin such as epicatechin-(4-8)-epicatechin-(4-8)-epicatechin or epicatechin-(4-8)-epicatechin-(4-8)-epicatechin-gallate.\n\nThe stimulant component may comprise at least one of caffeine, methylliberine, or theacrine. The stimulant component may additionally or alternatively include other stimulant compounds that increase alertness but provide no caloric energy described herein, such as one or more other adenosine receptor antagonists, other phosphodiesterase inhibitors, epinephrine and/or norepinephrine promoters or combinations thereof. Caffeine is a preferred stimulant component because it is widely utilized, well understood, well tolerated, easy to dose, and familiar to almost all users. Caffeine may assist the body in metabolizing available sources of caloric energy but is not itself a source of caloric energy. Methylliberine is an effective short-term stimulant. Theacrine is an effective long-term stimulant.\n\nThe individual components of the energy-promoting composition beneficially and synergistically interact together to enhance the overall energy-promoting effect of the composition and provide a more natural feeling energy boosting effect compared to popular gas station energy drinks. The combination of an exogenous ketone body component, vasodilator component, and stimulant component in a single formulation provides benefits not obtainable from a composition that includes only one or two of the components.\n\nThe caloric energy provided by the ketone body component attenuates the crash effect of the stimulant component by beneficially smoothing out and/or prolonging the experienced energy levels of the user. For example, the ketone body component provides a stable caloric energy source that avoids or minimizes the blood sugar swings and/or insulin spikes and/or mood swings commonly associated with conventional energy drinks containing a sugar component.\n\nThe vasodilator component beneficially counteracts the vasoconstriction of the stimulant component and also functions to improve the pharmacokinetic distribution of the other components. In other words, the vasodilator component functions to increase blood flow to peripheral tissues of the body so that the ketone bodies and the stimulant compound(s) can more effectively move from the digestive system to their intended targets (e.g., brain and muscle tissues).\n\nThe stimulant component beneficially interacts with the ketone body component by enhancing pharmacokinetic absorption and uptake of the ketone bodies into the tissues so it can be readily utilized as an energy source. In other words, the stimulant component, while providing no caloric energy, has been found to increase the efficiency in which the ketone body component is actually taken into cells and metabolized as caloric energy.\n\nIt is to be understood that both the foregoing general description and the following detailed description are exemplary and explanatory only and are not restrictive of the embodiments claimed.\n",

    "abstract": "A food processor including a receptacle configured to receive foodstuffs having a skin or peel, a first actuator operably coupled to the receptacle defining a first food processing range of motion, the receptacle selectively movable within the first food processing range of motion, and a second actuator operably coupled to a cutting member disposed in vertical juxtaposition to the receptacle, the cutting member selectively movable within a second food processing range of motion.\n\n",
    "description": "\n\nBACKGROUND\n\n\nThis disclosure relates generally, to the preparation of food and more particularly, to food processing appliances used to prepare food by conducting processing operations, including, but not limited to, peeling, chopping, slicing, dicing, and mincing, the foodstuff.\n\nWhile some fruits and vegetables have a skin or peel that can be generally higher in antioxidants, fiber, vitamins, and minerals than their flesh, certain fruits, like tropical fruits should always be peeled, despite the skin's nutritional content, because the skins are too difficult to chew and digest. The avocado is another fruit with skin that is so tough, it is inedible. Some vegetables, such as onions and garlic have a skin that might otherwise be digestible, but their skin is not nutritionally beneficial or tasty.\n\nConsumable garlic and garlic cloves, in particular, come from the garlic plant's bulb. Peeling garlic cloves can be difficult as cooks try to find a way to use their fingernails to scratch off the skin or to cut off the top of the clove with a knife in an attempt to then use their fingernails to peel back the skin in a direction toward the bottom of the clove. One way to peel garlic is to place a clove on a chopping board, then place the flat side of a knife against it and push down on the back of the knife with the hand. The knife will crush the clove downwards and loosen the skin, allowing less effort in scratching off the skins. Another method involves pulling apart all the cloves from the bulb and placing them in a mason jar with the lid on. The jar is shaken for 20 seconds or so, after which some of the cloves may have partially peeled themselves. Still, another handheld kitchen utensil, such as a garlic press or garlic crusher, forces the garlic cloves through a grate with the use of some type of piston.\n\nAn appliance that is designed to not only peel fruits and vegetables, but in addition, chop, slice, dice, and mince fruits and vegetables, would be a welcome addition to any household kitchen.\n\n\nSUMMARY\n\n\nA food processor appliance for fruits and vegetables, generally including, a receptacle configured to receive foodstuffs having a skin or peel, a first actuator operably coupled to the receptacle defining a first food processing range of motion, the receptacle selectively movable within the first food processing range of motion, and a second actuator operably coupled to a cutting member disposed in vertical juxtaposition to the receptacle, the cutting member selectively movable within a second food processing range of motion.\n\nIn accordance with an embodiment, a garlic processor appliance that leaves no odor on the hands, separates and catches the garlic skins for easy discard, and gathers either whole peeled cloves or processed garlic for easy transfer directly to any dish or recipe, generally includes, a receptacle configured to receive foodstuffs having a skin or peel, a first actuator operably coupled to the receptacle defining a first food processing range of motion, the receptacle selectively movable within the first food processing range of motion, and a second actuator operably coupled to a cutting member disposed in vertical juxtaposition to the receptacle, the cutting member selectively movable within a second food processing range of motion.\n",

    "description": "\n\nTECHNICAL FIELD\n\n\nOne or more exemplary embodiments of the present disclosure relate to an aerosol generating device, and more particularly, to an aerosol generating device having a structure that a user is unable to disassemble arbitrarily.\n\n\nBACKGROUND ART\n\n\nRecently, the demand for alternative methods to overcome the shortcomings of general cigarettes has increased. For example, there is an increasing demand for a method of generating aerosol by heating an aerosol generating material in cigarettes, rather than by burning cigarettes. Accordingly, studies on a heating-type cigarette or a heating-type aerosol generating device have been actively conducted.\n\nA non-combustion aerosol generating device refers to an apparatus which generates aerosols from an aerosol generating material included in a cigarette by heating the cigarette to a certain temperature without burning the cigarette, and allows a user to inhale the generated aerosols with air.\n\nThe non-combustion aerosol generating device is provided with a heater for heating the cigarette therein. Since the heater is heated to a high temperature, when the user disassembles the apparatus arbitrarily, the user may be easily exposed to a risk of being burned.\n\nIt is to be appreciated that the above-described background art is technical information kept by the inventors to obtain exemplary embodiments of the present disclosure or acquired by the inventors in the process of obtaining the exemplary embodiments, thus the background art may not have been known to the general public before the application of the exemplary embodiments of the present disclosure.\n\n\nDESCRIPTION OF EXEMPLARY EMBODIMENTS\n\n\n\nTechnical Problem\n\n\nOne or more exemplary embodiments of the present disclosure provide an aerosol generating device having a structure that a user is unable to disassemble arbitrarily.\n\nIn addition, one or more exemplary embodiments of the present disclosure may provide aerosols containing rich flavors, nicotine, and the like by passing the aerosols generated by heating an aerosol generating source through a cigarette.\n\n\nSolution to Problem\n\n\nAn exemplary embodiment of the present disclosure provides an aerosol generating device including: a case in which a heater for heating a cigarette is installed; a bracket for supporting components installed inside the case; a fastening member for fastening the case and the bracket; and a cap that is installed on an outer surface of the case in an inseparable manner to conceal the fastening member in the case.\n\nIn an exemplary embodiment, the cap includes a hook portion protruding in the lengthwise direction of the cigarette, wherein the hook portion may include a locking jaw protruding toward the inner surface of the case.\n\nIn an exemplary embodiment, the case may include a seating portion protruding toward the hook portion to seat the cap.\n\nIn an exemplary embodiment, when the cap is installed in the case, the seating portion may be engaged with the locking jaw, thus restricting upward movement of the cap upward.\n\nIn an exemplary embodiment, the surface where the seating portion and the locking jaw contact each other may be extended in a direction parallel to the width direction of the cigarette.\n\nIn an exemplary embodiment, the aerosol generating device may further include a stopper that is installed on the inner surface of the case, presses the hook portion in the direction in which the locking jaw protrudes, and thus restricts movement of the hook portion in the direction in which the seating portion protrudes.\n\nIn an exemplary embodiment, the locking jaw may include an inclined surface such that the seating portion slides on the inclined surface while the cap is being installed in the case.\n\nIn an exemplary embodiment, the seating portion may include a sliding surface such that the locking jaw slides on the sliding surface while the cap is being installed in the case.\n\nIn an exemplary embodiment, the aerosol generating device may further include a sealing member interposed between the case and the cap to seal the inside of the case.\n\nIn an exemplary embodiment, the case includes an upper case where the cigarette is inserted and heated and a lower case supporting and protecting various components installed therein, wherein the contact surfaces of the upper case and the cap, and of the upper case and the lower case may be joined by ultrasonic welding.\n\nIn an exemplary embodiment, the hook portion further includes an extension member extending in the lengthwise direction of the cigarette further than the locking jaw, and the stopper may press the extension member in the direction in which the locking jaw protrudes.\n\nIn an exemplary embodiment, along the lengthwise direction of the cigarette, the length of the extension member may be greater than the distance from the stopper to the surface where the seating portion and the cap contact each other.\n\nIn an exemplary embodiment, along the lengthwise direction of the cigarette, the width of the locking jaw may be less than or equal to the distance from the surface where the locking jaw and the seating portion engage with each other to the stopper.\n\nIn an exemplary embodiment, along the width direction of the cigarette, the width of the hook portion excluding the locking jaw may be less than the distance from the stopper to the locking jaw.\n\nIn the present an exemplary embodiment, along the width direction of the cigarette, the width of the hook portion including the locking jaw may be greater than the distance from the stopper to the locking jaw.\n\nIt is to be appreciated that the present disclosure is not limited to the above-described exemplary embodiments, and other features and advantages of the exemplary embodiments will be more fully understood from the following detailed description taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings, without departing from the true scope and spirit of the appended claims.\n\n\nAdvantageous Effects of Disclosure\n\n\nAs described above, one or more exemplary embodiments of the present disclosure may provide an aerosol generating device having a structure that a user is unable to disassemble arbitrarily since the user is unable to have access to a fastening member installed in a case due to an inseparable coupling structure of the case and cap.\n\nIn addition, the aerosol generating device may provide aerosols containing flavors, nicotine, and the like suitable for the user by passing the flow of the aerosols generated from an aerosol generating source through a cigarette.\n",

Â§ 371 of International Application No. PCT/EP2019/062846, filed May 17, 2019, published in English, which claims priority to European Application No. 18174434.3 filed May 25, 2018, Taiwanese Application No. 107147308 filed Dec. 27, 2018, and International Application No. PCT/EP2018/097074 filed Dec. 28, 2018, all of the disclosures of which are incorporated herein by reference.\n\n\nBACKGROUND\n\n\nIn traditional cigarettes tobacco is burned and the smoke is inhaled. An alternative to traditional cigarettes are heat-not-burn devices. Heat-not-burn devices heat tobacco at a lower temperature for vaporisation or aerosolisation, rather than burning it.\n\nHeating devices for vaporisation or aerosolisation of tobacco products are known in the art. Such devices typically include a heating chamber and heater. In operation, an operator inserts the tobacco product into the heating chamber. The tobacco product is then heated with an electronic heater to vaporise or aerosolise the constituents of the tobacco product for the operator to inhale. In some examples, the tobacco product may be stick shaped.\n\nAn issue faced by such heating devices is in keeping the device clean to prevent detrimental effects on the user experience.\n\n\nSUMMARY OF INVENTION\n\n\nAccording to an aspect the present invention provides a vapour generating device. The vapour generating device comprises a vapour generating place for receiving a vapour generating rod and a cover defining a closable opening to the vapour generating place; the cover being biased toward a closed position and openable from the closed position to an open position when receiving the vapour generating rod. In this way the vapour generating place is closed when a vapour generating rod is not inserted; this prevents dust and particulate matter from entering the vapour generating place. As the cover is biased to a closed position, when a vapour generating rod is inserted through the opening, the cover is urged against the vapour generating rod, thereby holding it in place. The closable opening is also advantageous as the user is not required to manually open and close the cover before and after inserting the vapour generating rod.\n\nAnother aspect of the present invention provides a vapour generating device comprising a vapour generating place for receiving a vapour generating rod, and a lid connectable to the vapour generating place, the lid comprising a closable opening to the vapour generating place, the closable opening being biased toward a closed position and openable from the closed position to an open position when receiving the vapour generating rod. In this way the vapour generating place is closed by the lid when a vapour generating rod is not inserted; this prevents dust and particulate matter from entering the vapour generating place. As the opening in the lid is biased to a closed position, when a vapour generating rod is inserted through the opening, the opening is urged against the vapour generating rod, thereby holding it in place. The closable opening is also advantageous as the user is not required to manually detach and reattach the lid before and after inserting the vapour generating rod.\n\nPreferably the closable opening or cover is arranged to be urged against a vapour generating rod received in the vapour generating place when in the open position. In this way a vapour generating rod received in the vapour generating place can be held securely in place by the closable opening.\n\nPreferably the closable opening or cover is arranged to be urged against a vapour generating rod received in the vapour generating place by elastic or resilient properties of the closable opening or cover.\n\nPreferably the cover can be arranged to be urged against a vapour generating rod by the vapour generating device comprising a membrane made from a resiliently flexible material with the closable opening arranged through the flexible membrane in the form of one or more slits. In this example the cover can be arranged to be urged against a vapour generating rod received in the vapour generating place by the resiliently flexible properties of the membrane urging the closable opening to the closed position; when the vapour generating rod is in the vapour generating place the one or more slits cannot reach the closed position and the membrane is urged against the vapour generating rod.\n\nAlternatively the cover can be arranged to be urged against a vapour generating rod by the cover being provided as a spring-loaded hinged cover; the spring-loaded hinged cover can be arranged to bias the cover toward a closed position and is openable when receiving a vapour generating rod by the vapour generating rod pressing against the cover such that it pivots about the hinge inwardly to the vapour generating place. In this example the cover can be arranged to be urged against a vapour generating rod received in the vapour generating place by the spring-loading of the hinge urging the cover to the closed position; when the vapour generating rod is in the vapour generating place the cover cannot reach the closed position and the cover is urged against the vapour generating rod. That is, the cover may close automatically due to the cover being biased to the closed position, and may be stopped from closing due to the presence of a vapour generating rod in the vapour generating place.\n\nIn another alternative the cover can be arranged to be urged against a vapour generating rod by the cover utilising an elastic rubber material. For example, the elastic rubber material can be arranged as a cover with one or more deformable slits arranged therethrough to function in a manner similar to the aforementioned membrane example, using a rubber cover in place of the membrane. In another example the elastic rubber material can be arranged in place of the spring in the aforementioned spring-loaded hinged cover example.\n\nPreferably the vapour generating device further comprises a lid connectable to the vapour generating place, wherein the closable opening is arranged in the lid.\n\nPreferably the lid comprises a flexible membrane, or the cover is a flexible membrane and the lid comprises the flexible membrane, the closable opening being through the flexible membrane. In this way the flexible membrane can deform from the closed position to the open position when pressure is applied by the vapour generating rod. When the vapour generating rod is removed from the opening the resilient nature of the flexible membrane can bias the opening back toward the closed position thereby preventing particulate matter entering the vapour generating place. The arrangement of the flexible membrane and the closable opening is advantageous as it is a simple structure and there is no need for extra components or a manual opening and closing of the lid before the insertion and after the removal of the vapour generating rod.\n\nPreferably the flexible membrane is surrounded by a surrounding portion, and more preferably the surrounding portion is made from a robust material. In this way the robust surrounding portion can be used to securely fasten the lid to the body of the vapour generating device. The flexible membrane may be in the centre of the surrounding portion.\n\nPreferably the flexible membrane is projected outwardly from the surrounding portion.\n\nPreferably the closable opening includes at least one slit in the flexible membrane. In this way the at least one slit can deform due to pressure applied from the vapour generating rod; this allows for the vapour generating rod to be easily received through the flexible membrane. Due to the resilient nature of the flexible membrane deformed portions of the membrane adjacent to the slit(s) can be urged against the vapour generating rod thereby holding it securely in place.\n\nPreferably the at least one slit extends radially from a point on the membrane. In this way a vapour generating rod with a circular cross section can be securely accommodated by the membrane.\n\nPreferably the at least one slit is curved. This has been found to contribute to securely holding in place a vapour generating rod received through the flexible membrane.\n\nPreferably there are two or more slits, and the two or more slits are the same length, the same shape, and/or arranged with an equal angle therebetween. These options have each been found to contribute to securely holding in place a vapour generating rod received through the flexible membrane.\n\nPreferably the lid is removable from the vapour generating device. In this way the vapour generating place can be easily accessed for cleaning. A further advantage is provided in that the lid can be replaced, if required, without replacing the entire device.\n\nAccording to another aspect the present invention provides a system comprising the vapour generating device comprising a vapour generating rod inserted through the closable opening. In this way the vapour generating rod can be received by the vapour generating place so that it may be heated, with the lid or cover closing the vapour generating place when the vapour generating rod is not inserted to prevent dust and particulate matter building up in the vapour generating place. This is also advantageous as the user is not required to manually detach and reattach the lid before and after inserting the vapour generating rod.\n\nPreferably the vapour generating device further comprises a lid connectable to the vapour generating place, wherein the closable opening is arranged in the lid.\n\nPreferably the cover is biased toward a closed position when the vapour generating rod is removed from the closable opening. In this way, when the vapour generating rod is removed from the closable opening, the cover is biased to the closed position without the user having to manually close a lid and without the need for any extra components to close the opening.\n\nPreferably, in an example in which the cover is the flexible membrane, the flexible membrane biases the at least one slit toward a closed positon when the vapour generating rod is removed from the slit. In this way, when the vapour generating rod is removed from the at least one slit, the resilient nature of the flexible membrane can bias the slit to a closed position without the user having to manually close a lid and without the need for any extra components to close the opening or a lid.\n\nPreferably the vapour generating place is of a length shorter than that of the vapour generating rod such that when the vapour generating rod is inserted through the closable opening, into the vapour generating place, a mouthpiece end of the vapour generating rod extends outward from the vapour generating place or heating cavity through the closable opening. In this way the vapour generating rod can be easily removed from the vapour generating device with the lid or opening closing in one action. This also allows for the user to access the mouthpiece of the vapour generating rod whilst it is in the vapour generating place.\n\nPreferably the vapour generating rod is a smoking device such as a smoking article i.e. a tobacco rod or cigarette, or any other type of material suitable for vaporisation or aerosolisation for inhalation by a consumer.\n\nThe vapour generating rod may include a rod with a vaporisable substance (such as tobacco) wrapped in a wrapper, such as paper, in the shape of a rod. The vapour generating rod may have a filter such as an acetate filter at its end.\n\nThe vaporisable substance may be any suitable substance capable of forming a vapour. The substance may be a solid or semi-solid substance. The substance may comprise plant derived material and in particular, the substance may comprise tobacco. Typically, the vaporisable substance is a solid or semi-solid tobacco substance. Example types of vapour generating solids or semi-solids include powder, granules, pellets, shreds, strands, porous material, foam or sheets. The substance may be a tobacco foam; tobacco foam typically comprises a plurality of fine tobacco particles and can typically also comprise a volume of water and/or a moisture additive, such as a humectant. The tobacco foam may be porous, and may allow a flow of air or vapour through the foam. Preferably, the vaporisable substance may comprise an aerosol-former. Examples of aerosol-formers include polyhyrdric alcohols and mixtures thereof such as glycerine or propylene glycol. Typically, the vaporisable substance may comprise an aerosol-former content of between approximately 5% and approximately 50% on a dry weight basis. Preferably, the vaporisable substance may comprise an aerosol-former content of approximately 10-20% on a dry weight basis.\n\nPreferably the vapour generating place can comprise a cavity arranged to receive a vapour generating rod, and to provide heat from a heater which can be arranged in the cavity to a received vapour generating rod for the vaporisation or aerosolisation of the vapour generating rod material, i.e. the vapour generating place can be a heating cavity.\n\nThe lid may be internally threaded arranged to connect with an external thread of the body of the vapour generating device, or the lid may be arranged to connect to the body of the vapour generating device by a bayonet connection or a push connection. In this way the lid can be removably connected to the body of the vapour generating device.\n\nThe lid may have a surrounding portion made from a robust material such as a hard plastic or metal.\n\nThe heater may be an induction-type heater such as a combination of an induction coil and susceptor, an element-type heater, an infra-red heater, a laser heater, or any other suitable means for heating a tobacco product. An ultrasonic vaporiser may be arranged in the cavity instead of, or in addition to, the heater.\n\nThe closable opening, or the cover defining the closable opening, may be biased toward a closed position and openable from the closed position to an open position when receiving the vapour generating rod by way of a lid or cover connected to the body by a spring-loaded hinge arranged to bias the lid or cover toward the closed position.\n",

    "description": "\n\nCROSS REFERENCE TO THE RELATED APPLICATIONS\n\n\nThis application is the national phase entry of International Application No. PCT/CN2020/141628, filed on Dec. 30, 2020, the entire contents of which are incorporated herein by reference.\n\n\nTECHNICAL FIELD\n\n\nThe present invention belongs to the technical field of analysis and detection, and particularly relates to a test system and a test method for a lip sticking force of tipping paper for cigarettes.\n\n\nBACKGROUND\n\n\nA cigarette filter is composed of three layers, namely, acetate fiber, plug wrap paper and tipping paper. The tipping paper, also known as tip paper for a cigarette, is used to wrap the filter and bond the filter to the end of the cigarette. The tipping paper is a kind of decorative paper obtained by printing and coating the tipping base paper and processing by other methods. It is often cork or opaque white, and has the effect of improving the appearance. The tipping paper is in direct contact with the lips of smokers. Generally, only paint or ink is used to be printed on the tipping paper. When the weather is dry and consumers smoke cigarettes, a small amount of saliva may wet the tipping paper, and dry slowly during smoking. The saliva protein remaining on the lips has a binding effect on the tipping paper, so that the tipping paper on the filter sticks to the skin of the lips, and even causes the lips to tear and bleed. After smoking, the filter cannot be spit out smoothly, which seriously affects the experience of cigarette consumers.\n\nAt present, there is no measurement of the lip sticking force of the tipping paper for the cigarettes in China and other countries. Various Chinese tobacco companies and manufacturers of auxiliary materials for cigarettes mostly use artificial sensory evaluation to determine whether the tipping paper for the cigarettes sticks to the lips. No relevant standards have been issued, resulting in a big difference between the test and the determining results. In order to standardize the quality of the auxiliary materials for cigarettes, increase the comfort of cigarette consumers, and reduce the use rate of the tipping paper for the cigarettes with the lip sticking force, it is necessary to accurately measure and determine the lip sticking force of the tipping paper for the cigarettes, and establish the corresponding objective screening test method and test equipment.\n\n\nSUMMARY\n\n\nThe present invention is proposed to solve the above-mentioned problems.\n\nThe present invention provides a test system for a lip sticking force of tipping paper for cigarettes. The test system includes: an artificial lip and test equipment.\n\nThe artificial lip is a silica gel block or a 3M low-viscosity tape.\n\nThe test equipment includes: a friction meter testing platform, a force measuring sensor, a rigid rope, a pulley, a pulley bracket and a sample loading module.\n\nThe pulley is installed on the pulley bracket, and the rigid rope slides in the pulley. The rigid rope is L-shaped, one end of the rigid rope in the horizontal direction is connected to the force measuring sensor, and the other end of the rigid rope in the vertical direction is connected to the sample loading module.\n\nThe artificial lip is located directly below the sample loading module, and the artificial lip is in contact with the sample loading module at a test position.\n\nA friction resistance test software is installed in the friction meter testing platform, the friction meter testing platform is communicatively connected to the force measuring sensor, and the friction meter testing platform controls movement of the rigid rope and records changes of a force on the rigid rope with time and/or position.\n\nThe friction resistance test software is commercial software having a MAP software full name of MAP4.exe and purchased by Thwing-Albert Company.\n\nThe artificial lip may be a silica gel block or a 3M low-viscosity tape.\n\nPreferably, the test system may further include: artificial saliva. During a test, the artificial saliva may be sprayed on a test surface of the artificial lip. In order to simulate human conditions more accurately, the artificial saliva at 36-37 degrees Celsius can be used.\n\nPreferably, the artificial saliva may contain sodium chloride, potassium chloride, calcium chloride, sodium dihydrogen phosphate, magnesium chloride, urea, glucose, mucin, amylase, acid phosphatase and lysozyme.\n\nPreferably, the artificial saliva may contain 1.40 mmol/L of sodium chloride, 0.5 mmol/L of potassium chloride, 0.1 mmol/L of calcium chloride, 0.15 mmol/L of sodium dihydrogen phosphate, 0.025 mmol/L of magnesium chloride, 0.09 mmol/L of urea, 0.2 mmol/L of glucose, 2.7 mmol/L of bovine submandibular gland salivary mucin, 2.5 units/mL of amylase, 0.004 units/mL of acid phosphatase, and 0.7 units/mL of lysozyme.\n\nPreferably, the artificial lip may be detachably installed on an artificial lip bracket, and a horizontal adjusting component may be arranged under the artificial lip bracket. A horizontal adjusting nut may be used as the horizontal adjusting component to ensure that the artificial lip is placed horizontally.\n\nPreferably, both ends of the rigid rope may be connected to the force measuring sensor and the sample loading module through a movable connecting piece, respectively. A snap ring may be used as the movable connecting piece. The movable connecting piece used can balance the force, and ensure that the force of the rigid rope on the force measuring sensor and the sample loading module acts on the entire surface of the contact surface on average. The snap ring is optional for the movable connecting piece.\n\nIf the rigid rope and the sample loading module are directly connected to the movable connecting piece, when the rigid rope pulls the sample loading module away from the artificial lip, the sample loading module and the artificial lip may start to separate at a certain corner of the contact surface between the two, resulting in inaccurate mechanical test results and poor repeatability.\n\nPreferably, the sample loading module may include a counterweight and an elastic pad, where the elastic pad is fixed at a lower end of the sample loading module.\n\nA rubber pad or silica gel block is optional for the elastic pad, and a metal block is optional for the counterweight.\n\nA second aspect of the present invention provides a test method for a lip sticking force of tipping paper for cigarettes, using the test system according to the first aspect to perform a test. The test method includes the following steps:\n\n\nDuring the test, the maximum force on the rigid rope is a force at the moment of separation between the tipping paper and the artificial lip. At this time, the force is maximum, and called the lip sticking force.\n\nAlternatively, during the test, the friction meter testing platform records changes of a force on the rigid rope with time and/or position, and naturally marks a peak value of the force, which is the lip sticking force.\n\nAs some tipping paper is punched, when a width of the tipping paper is cut to 1.5 cm, a punched area is avoided, and test results will be more accurate at this time.\n\nPreferably, a running speed of the rigid rope may be controlled by the friction meter testing platform to be 40-60 mm/min, and a contact time of the artificial lip and the to-be-tested tipping paper sample may be 4-6 s.\n\nMore preferably, the running speed of the rigid rope may be controlled by the friction meter testing platform to be 50 mm/min, and the contact time of the artificial lip and the to-be-tested tipping paper sample may be 5-6 s.\n\nPreferably, a method for attaching the to-be-tested tipping paper sample to the lower end of the sample loading module may include: attaching the to-be-tested tipping paper sample to a side of a counterweight of the sample loading module, so that a middle of the to-be-tested tipping paper completely fits with an elastic pad at the lower end of the sample loading module.\n\nDuring the test, first, one side of the to-be-tested tipping paper sample is adhered to one side of the counterweight of the sample loading module, and then the to-be-tested tipping paper sample is manually tightened, so that the middle part completely fits with the elastic pad. Then, the other side of the to-be-tested tipping paper sample is adhered to the other side of the counterweight of the sample loading module. The reasons why an adhesive is not used at the contact between the to-be-tested tipping paper and the elastic pad are as follows: 1, The surface of the to-be-tested tipping paper is uneven after adhesion of the adhesive, resulting in an uneven contact surface during contact with the artificial lip, and affecting the test accuracy. 2, After the adhesive is adhered to the elastic pad, the weight changes greatly, which affects a mechanical test value. 3, If the adhesive is adhered to the elastic pad, it is inconvenient to replace the tipping paper for the cigarettes, each time it is not cleaned, the next test is affected, thereby affecting the test results.\n\nPreferably, before the artificial lip is in contact with the to-be-tested tipping paper sample, artificial saliva may be sprayed on the artificial lip.\n\nPreferably, a movable cover plate bracket may be designed with a drawer type process, and a movable cover plate may be loaded in the middle, which is convenient for disassembly and assembly of the artificial lip.\n\nIn the present invention, it is preferable to place the tipping paper for the cigarettes on a cutting board for cutting, and a width of the to-be-tested tipping paper sample after the cutting is equal to a width of the sample loading module of the test equipment. An upper surface area of an artificial lip sample block must also be consistent with a bottom area of the sample loading module. Gloves are worn during operation to avoid direct contact between hands and test samples.\n\nThe above technical solutions can be freely combined without contradiction.\n\nThe present invention has the following beneficial effects.\n\n1. The present invention provides the test equipment and test method for the lip sticking force of the tipping paper for the cigarettes, which can objectively and accurately detect the lip sticking force of the tipping paper for the cigarettes, effectively avoid the fuzzy concepts of lip sticking feeling and lip injury obtained by means of traditional sensory evaluation, and avoid the defects of major influence of subjective factors, large differences in smoking results and harm to human health.\n\n2. Through the normal running of the test equipment, the test sample is in full contact with the artificial lip to obtain the lip sticking force, which has good repeatability and good consistency with the artificial sensory evaluation, so the test accuracy is high. The test method is simple and feasible, and has certain advantages in material access, quality control, and product upgrades in the tobacco industry.\n\n3. The method according to the present invention is fast, objective and efficient, is good in repeatability and simple in operation, greatly saves test costs, improves efficiency, and is easy to popularize and apply.\n",
